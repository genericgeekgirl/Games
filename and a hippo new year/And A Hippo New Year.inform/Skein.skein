&apos;Twas the night before Christmas when all through the house, the only creature stirring was a hippo the size of a mouse.

This year you&apos;re going to stay awake long enough to see Santa Claws. You have set up a temporary nest in the hallway closet, and it just needs a few final touches. You intend to venture out to have a snack and look at the tree one more time, and then you will go hide in the closet and wait.

And A Hippo New Year
an interactive holiday tale by Adri (&quot;Erin Gigglecreek&quot;)
Release 1 / Serial number 130108 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) SD

If you are unfamiliar with Interactive Fiction, type HELP for a quick introduction on how to play. 

Living Room
There is a tree here, decorated with ornaments and surrounded by piles of presents. There is also a table off to one side. The hallway closet is to the southeast.

Yuletide offerings are anonymous until New Year&apos;s Day. Until then, &quot;Erin&quot; can be contacted with feedback at gigglecreek@gmail.com.

The house hippo was created by the Concerned Children&apos;s Advertisers, and appears here without permission. The original PSA is short and super cute, and can be viewed on CCA&apos;s YouTube channel at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9hJK4fCq4U.

&gt;[1] x presents
There are piles of presents surrounding the tree. There is one rather tall pile of presents in a neat stack.

&gt;[2] push presents
You don&apos;t have any reason to push those around. Yet.

&gt;[3] look under tree
You don&apos;t see much with all the presents in the way.

&gt;[4] wear hat
You can&apos;t see any such thing.

&gt;[5] up
You climb to the top of the presents. You seem to be about level with a table, on which stands a glass of milk and a plate of cookies. The pile starts to wobble, and you quickly make your way back down.

Living Room
There is a tree here, decorated with ornaments and surrounded by piles of presents. There is also a table, about the same height as the stack of presents under the tree. The hallway closet is to the southeast.

&gt;[6] eat cookie
You can&apos;t see any such thing.

&gt;[7] push milk
You can&apos;t see any such thing.

&gt;[8] look under table
You find the remains of a melted icicle.

&gt;[9] drink puddle
You lap at the cold water and feel instantly refreshed.

Hallway Closet
This is the closet where you will be spending the night. It is full of things that you don&apos;t need to think about right now.

You can see your nest and a mitten here.

&gt;[11] take mitten
You pick up the wet mitten. Ick. Soggy mittens don&apos;t make good bedding material.

Living Room
There is a tree here, decorated with ornaments and surrounded by piles of presents. There is also a table, about the same height as the stack of presents under the tree. The hallway closet is to the southeast.

&gt;[13] put mitten on lights
You lay the mitten across the string of lights where it nearly touches the floor.

&gt;[14] take garland
You tug on a dangling bit of garland with your teeth. A piece breaks off, about as long as you are.

Living Room
There is a tree here, decorated with ornaments and surrounded by piles of presents. There is also a table, about the same height as the stack of presents under the tree. The hallway closet is to the southeast.

The mitten starts to smoke. You&apos;d better go get it before you burn down the house.

&gt;[18] take mitten
You quickly retrieve the mitten. It is now dry, and almost too hot to touch.

You can only carry one thing in your mouth at a time. But some items can be pushed around or worn.

There is a tree here, decorated with ornaments and surrounded by piles of presents. There is also a table, about the same height as the stack of presents under the tree. The hallway closet is to the southeast.

You climb to the top of the presents. You seem to be about level with a table, on which stands a glass of milk and a plate of cookies. The pile starts to wobble, and you quickly make your way back down.

Living Room
There is a tree here, decorated with ornaments and surrounded by piles of presents. There is also a table, about the same height as the stack of presents under the tree. The hallway closet is to the southeast.

You push the bottom package with your head, being careful to prevent the pile from falling over. It&apos;s hard work, but eventually you move the entire stack over to the table.

You scramble up the pile of presents onto the table top.

High above the Living Room
You are standing on top of the table.

You can see a plate of cookies and a glass of milk here.

That cookie is larger than you are. Maybe you can roll it.

Visions of raisins dance in your head.

&gt;[1] x presents
There are piles of presents surrounding the tree. There is one rather tall pile of presents in a neat stack.

&gt;[2] up
You climb to the top of the presents. You seem to be about level with the table, on which stands a glass of milk and a plate of cookies. The pile starts to wobble, and you quickly make your way back down.

Living Room
There is a tree here, decorated with ornaments and surrounded by piles of presents. There is also a table, about the same height as the stack of presents under the tree. The hallway closet is to the southeast.

&gt;[3] push presents
You push the bottom package with your head, being careful to prevent the pile from falling over. It&apos;s hard work, but eventually you move the entire stack over to the table.

You are feeling very thirsty.

&gt;[4] look under tree
You find a tiny santa hat. It must have fallen off one of the ornaments.

You can only carry one thing in your mouth at a time. But some items can be pushed around or worn. You drop the mitten to pick up the santa hat.

You find yourself staring at the Christmas lights and wondering how it would taste.

&gt;[5] wear hat
You slip the hat on over your ears. You look adorable!

[Your score has just gone up by one point.]

&gt;[6] up
You scramble up the pile of presents onto the table top.

High above the Living Room
You are standing on top of the table.

You can see a plate of cookies and a glass of milk here.

&gt;[7] eat cookie
You nibble hungrily at the cookie.

[Your score has just gone up by five points.]

&gt;[8] push milk
The glass of milk goes crashing to the floor. A light goes on in the hallway, and you quickly dash back down the pile of presents and hide behind a table leg.

One of the big humans of the house wanders sleepily into the room. She cleans up the milk and broken glass, mutters something about the cat and goes back to bed.

Living Room
There is a tree here, decorated with ornaments and surrounded by piles of presents. There is also a table, next to which is a neat stack of presents, forming a staircase to the top. The hallway closet is to the southeast.

You find the remains of a melted icicle underneath the table.

&gt;[10] drink puddle
You lap at the cold water and feel instantly refreshed.

&gt;[14] put mitten on lights
You lay the mitten across the string of lights where it nearly touches the floor.

You put the mitten on the nest.

You are feeling very tired. Maybe you could just take a quick nap.

&gt;[22] enter nest
You get onto the nest.

On the nest you can see a mitten and a piece of garland.

You yawn loudly. It is getting late.

&gt;[23] sleep
You close your eyes, just for a moment... When you awaken, it is daytime and there is a tiny wrapped present next to your nest. Oh well. Maybe next year!

You climb to the top of the presents. You seem to be about level with a table, on which stands a glass of milk and a plate of cookies. The pile starts to wobble, and you quickly make your way back down.

Living Room
There is a tree here, under which is a stack of presents. There is also a table,.

You push the bottom package with your head, being careful to prevent the pile from falling over. It&apos;s hard work, but eventually you move the entire stack over to the table.

Your tummy makes a rumbling sound.

You climb to the top of the presents. You seem to be about level with a table, on which stands a glass of milk and a plate of cookies. The pile starts to wobble, and you quickly make your way back down.

Living Room
There is a tree here, under which is a stack of presents. There is also a table,.

You push the bottom package with your head, being careful to prevent the pile from falling over. It&apos;s hard work, but eventually you move the entire stack over to the table.

You are a hungry, hungry hippo.

You scramble up the pile of presents onto the table top.

You can see a plate of cookies and a glass of milk here.

You take a cookie. It&apos;s larger than you are.

The cat hisses at you.

You growl menacingly at the cat. The cat hisses at you, arching its back.

You would give anything right now for a pile of potato chip crumbs.

&gt;[1] x presents
There are piles of presents surrounding the tree. There is one rather tall pile of presents in a neat stack.

&gt;[2] up
You climb to the top of the presents. You seem to be about level with a table, on which stands a glass of milk and a plate of cookies. The pile starts to wobble, and you quickly make your way back down.

Living Room
There is a tree here, decorated with ornaments and surrounded by piles of presents. There is also a table, about the same height as the stack of presents under the tree. The hallway closet is to the southeast.

&gt;[3] push presents
You push the bottom package with your head, being careful to prevent the pile from falling over. It&apos;s hard work, but eventually you move the entire stack over to the table.

Visions of raisins dance in your head.

&gt;[4] up
You scramble up the pile of presents onto the table top.

High above the Living Room
You are standing on top of the table.

You can see a plate of cookies and a glass of milk here.

&gt;[5] take cookie
That cookie is larger than you are. Maybe you can roll it.

&gt;[6] push milk
The glass of milk goes crashing to the floor. A light goes on in the hallway, and you quickly dash back down the pile of presents and hide behind a table leg.

One of the big humans of the house wanders sleepily into the room. She cleans up the milk and broken glass, mutters something about the cat and goes back to bed.

Living Room
There is a tree here, decorated with ornaments and surrounded by piles of presents. There is also a table, next to which is a neat stack of presents, forming a staircase to the top. The hallway closet is to the southeast.

&apos;Twas the night before Christmas when all through the house, the only creature stirring was a hippo the size of a mouse.

This year you&apos;re going to stay awake long enough to see Santa Claws. You have set up a temporary nest in the hallway closet, and it just needs a few final touches. You intend to venture out to have a snack and look at the tree one more time, and then you will go hide in the closet and wait.

&apos;Twas the night before Christmas when all through the house, the only creature stirring was a hippo the size of a mouse.

This year you&apos;re going to stay awake long enough to see Santa Claws. You have set up a temporary nest in the hallway closet, and it just needs a few final touches. You intend to venture out to have a snack and look at the tree one more time, and then you will go hide in the closet and wait.

And A Hippo New Year
an interactive holiday tale by Erin Gigglecreek

If you are unfamiliar with Interactive Fiction, type HELP for a quick introduction on how to play. 

Living Room
There is a tree here, decorated with ornaments and surrounded by piles of presents. There is also a table off to one side. The hallway closet is to the southeast.

&apos;Twas the night before Christmas when all through the house, the only creature stirring was a hippo the size of a mouse.

This year you&apos;re going to stay awake long enough to see Santa Claws. You have set up a temporary nest in the hallway closet, and it just needs a few final touches. You intend to venture out to have a snack and look at the tree one more time, and then you will go hide in the closet and wait.

&gt;[1] x presents
There are piles of presents surrounding the tree. There is one rather tall pile of presents in a neat stack.

&gt;[2] up
You climb to the top of the presents. You seem to be about level with the table, on which stands a glass of milk and a plate of cookies. The pile starts to wobble, and you quickly make your way back down.

Living Room
There is a tree here, decorated with ornaments and surrounded by piles of presents. There is also a table, about the same height as the stack of presents under the tree. The hallway closet is to the southeast.

&gt;[3] push presents
You push the bottom package with your head, being careful to prevent the pile from falling over. It&apos;s hard work, but eventually you move the entire stack over to the table.

Visions of raisins dance in your head.

&gt;[4] look under tree
You find a tiny santa hat. It must have fallen off one of the ornaments.

&gt;[5] wear hat
You slip the hat on over your ears. You look adorable!

[Your score has just gone up by one point.]

&gt;[6] up
You scramble up the pile of presents onto the table top.

High above the Living Room
You are standing on top of the table.

You can see a plate of cookies and a glass of milk here.

You find yourself staring at the santa hat and wondering how it would taste.

&gt;[7] eat cookie
You nibble hungrily at the cookie.

[Your score has just gone up by five points.]

&gt;[8] push milk
The glass of milk goes crashing to the floor. A light goes on in the hallway, and you quickly dash back down the pile of presents and hide behind a table leg.

One of the big humans of the house wanders sleepily into the room. She cleans up the milk and broken glass, mutters something about the cat and goes back to bed.

Living Room
There is a tree here, decorated with ornaments and surrounded by piles of presents. There is also a table, next to which is a neat stack of presents, forming a staircase to the top. The hallway closet is to the southeast.

Hallway Closet
This is the closet where you will be spending the night. It is full of things that you don&apos;t need to think about right now.

You can see your nest and a mitten here.

&gt;[12] take mitten
You pick up the wet mitten. Ick. Soggy mittens don&apos;t make good bedding material.

The author can be contacted at &lt;genericgeekgirl@gmail.com&gt;. Thanks so much to my beta testers, who were happy to give me feedback on incredibly short notice: Jacqueline A. Lott, Matthew Miller, Ryan Spicer, Scott McCasland and Zach.

The house hippo was created by the Concerned Children&apos;s Advertisers, and appears here without permission. The original PSA is short and super cute, and can be viewed on CCA&apos;s YouTube channel at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9hJK4fCq4U.

&gt;[3] push presents
You push the bottom package with your head, being careful to prevent the pile from falling over. It&apos;s hard work, but eventually you move the entire stack over to the table.

You would give anything right now for a pile of potato chip crumbs.

&gt;[4] look under tree
You find a tiny santa hat. It must have fallen off one of the ornaments.

&gt;[5] wear hat
You slip the hat on over your ears. You look adorable!
