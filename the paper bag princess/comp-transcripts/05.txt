This is the day you've always dreamed of. You are finally marrying the love of your life, Prince Roland.


Castle Garden
You are standing in the garden behind your family's castle. On this lovely fall evening, it is doing double duty as a wedding chapel.

Your betrothed, Roland, stands before you.

You can also see Father Alfred here.

>leave
But you aren't in anything at the moment.

Father Alfred begins the ceremony, "We are gathered here today to witness the joining of two hearts." Roland smiles shyly at you.

>kick
That's not a verb I recognize.

>punch
What do you want to punch?

>roland
You would never attack Roland! Except possibly with kisses.

"If anyone has a reason why these two should not be wed, speak now or forever hold your peace." You hold your breath for a second, wondering whether anyone will speak up. Fortunately, nobody does and you relax.

>speak up
Whom do you want to speak that to?

>father
You can only do that to something animate.

>speak to roland
I only understood you as far as wanting to speak.

>speak roland
Whom do you want to speak that to?

>alfred
Father Alfred smiles kindly at you and continues the ceremony.

"Who gives this woman--" You glare icily at the minister. You are nobody's property. "Ahem. Moving on," says the minister, visibly flustered. Roland looks at you questioningly, but says nothing.

>spin
That's not a verb I recognize.

>twirl
That's not a verb I recognize.

>handstand
That's not a verb I recognize.

>produce rapier
That's not a verb I recognize.

>stand
But you aren't in anything at the moment.

"Love is a wonderful thing." And so on. You're too excited to pay attention to every word.

>jump
You jump on the spot, fruitlessly.

"Elizabeth, do you take Roland to be your husband?"

>yes
Of course you do!

The minister smiles at you and turns to Roland. "And, Roland, do you take Elizabeth to be your wife?"

Roland grins at you and exclaims, "I do!"

"I now pronounce you man and... dragon?!?" The minister's eyes go wide, seconds before he is incinerated by a burst of flame.

A large dragon flies overhead. The wedding guests scatter in every direction. You cower against Roland, but he pushes you towards the dragon and runs towards the road.

The dragon eats all the guests it can catch, and when it has had its fill, it smashes your castle to smithereens with its heavy tail and sets the remains on fire. You are nearly caught in a blaze of flame as you duck behind what used to be the stone wall of the garden. You are unhurt, but your fine gown snags on a rose bush and tears.

As the dragon finally turns to go, it catches sight of Roland, running down the road towards the river. It swoops down and smashes the bridge just as Roland is about to cross it and catches him up in its claws. The dragon flies away with your beloved prince.

The Paper Bag Princess
An interactive fairy tale by Adri
Release 1 / Serial number 130928 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) 

Castle Ruins
This used to be your home. Now it is nothing more than a smoking pile of rubble. The smoke obscures your view of the stars, and the primary source of light is the burning remains of your furniture.

The only road away from the castle now ends abruptly at the river bank. The forest surrounds you thickly on all sides, except for an area to the north where the trees have been broken and scorched.

>save

Ok.

>go north
Perhaps you should find something to wear first.

>search rubble
You dig through the piles of rubble until you find a paper bag.

>eat bag
(first taking the paper bag)
You take the paper bag.

That's plainly inedible.

>look at bag
It's a gift bag made out of paper. It looks like it used to have polka dots on it, but now it's just scorched.

>wear bag
You quickly fashion a dress out of the gift bag. It's not as fancy as you're used to, but it'll get the job done.

You strip off the remains of your wedding gown.

You slip the makeshift dress over your head and pull it down past your hips.

>go north

Burnt Forest
There's a trail of burned trees and what appear to be teeth leading to the northeast. One tree in particular catches your eye.

>look at tree
You examine the tree more closely. Someone has carved "PLUGH" into the trunk.

There is a large branch propped up against the base of the tree.

>take branch
You take the branch.

>swing branch
There's nothing sensible to swing here.

>attack tree
Violence isn't the answer to this one.

>search
What do you want to search?

>area
You can't see any such thing.

>look around
You can't see any such thing.

>search tree
You find nothing of interest.

>go north
The trees are impassable in that direction. The trail seems to be leading northeast.

>follow trail
That's not a verb I recognize.

>go northeast
The woods seem pretty dark. Maybe you should find a light source.

>find light source
You can't see any such thing.

>make fire
I didn't understand that sentence.

>search
What do you want to search?

>woods
You can't see any such thing.

>gather wood
That's not a verb I recognize.

>use branch
That's not a verb I recognize.
