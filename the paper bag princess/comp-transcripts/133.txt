This is the day you've always dreamed of. You are finally marrying the love of your life, Prince Roland.


Castle Garden
You are standing in the garden behind your family's castle. On this lovely fall evening, it is doing double duty as a wedding chapel.

Your betrothed, Roland, stands before you.

You can also see Father Alfred here.

>marry a princess
You can't see any such thing.

>marry another princess
You can't see any such thing.

>kill self
Violence isn't the answer to this one.

Father Alfred begins the ceremony, "We are gathered here today to witness the joining of two hearts." Roland smiles shyly at you.

>kill roland
You would never attack Roland! Except possibly with kisses.

"If anyone has a reason why these two should not be wed, speak now or forever hold your peace." You hold your breath for a second, wondering whether anyone will speak up. Fortunately, nobody does and you relax.

>kiss roland
You'll have your chance soon enough!

"Who gives this woman--" You glare icily at the minister. You are nobody's property. "Ahem. Moving on," says the minister, visibly flustered. Roland looks at you questioningly, but says nothing.

>kiss father
Keep your mind on the game.

"Love is a wonderful thing." And so on. You're too excited to pay attention to every word.

>kick father
That's not a verb I recognize.

>kill father
Violence isn't the answer to this one.

"Elizabeth, do you take Roland to be your husband?"

>kill self
The minister is waiting for your answer. Please say "yes" or "no".

>sing
There will be plenty of time to sing later.

>jump
The minister is waiting for your answer. Please say "yes" or "no".

>dance
You shuffle your feet unnoticeably underneath your floor-length gown.

>no
You shake your head. "No. I don't."

Oh.

There's a pause, and then the guests begin to murmur. The minister frowns. "Elizabeth, are you sure?" he asks. Roland just stares at you in shock. You whisper, "I'm so sorry," and run off.



    *** And they didn't get married after all! ***
