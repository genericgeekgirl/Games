This is the day you've always dreamed of. You are finally marrying the love of your life, Prince Roland.


Castle Garden
You are standing in the garden behind your family's castle. On this lovely fall evening, it is doing double duty as a wedding chapel.

Your betrothed, Roland, stands before you.

You can also see Father Alfred here.

>x me
You are young and beautiful, too lovely to be described in mere words.

You are wearing a wedding gown and a sparkly gold crown.

Father Alfred begins the ceremony, "We are gathered here today to witness the joining of two hearts." Roland smiles shyly at you.

>z
You beam happily at Roland.

"If anyone has a reason why these two should not be wed, speak now or forever hold your peace." You hold your breath for a second, wondering whether anyone will speak up. Fortunately, nobody does and you relax.

>z
You beam happily at Roland.

"Who gives this woman--" You glare icily at the minister. You are nobody's property. "Ahem. Moving on," says the minister, visibly flustered. Roland looks at you questioningly, but says nothing.

>z
You beam happily at Roland.

"Love is a wonderful thing." And so on. You're too excited to pay attention to every word.

>z
You beam happily at Roland.

"Elizabeth, do you take Roland to be your husband?"

>say i do
Whom do you want to say that to?

>say i do to roland
The minister is waiting for your answer. Please say "yes" or "no".

>yes
Of course you do!

The minister smiles at you and turns to Roland. "And, Roland, do you take Elizabeth to be your wife?"

Roland grins at you and exclaims, "I do!"

"I now pronounce you man and... dragon?!?" The minister's eyes go wide, seconds before he is incinerated by a burst of flame.

A large dragon flies overhead. The wedding guests scatter in every direction. You cower against Roland, but he pushes you towards the dragon and runs towards the road.

The dragon eats all the guests it can catch, and when it has had its fill, it smashes your castle to smithereens with its heavy tail and sets the remains on fire. You are nearly caught in a blaze of flame as you duck behind what used to be the stone wall of the garden. You are unhurt, but your fine gown snags on a rose bush and tears.

As the dragon finally turns to go, it catches sight of Roland, running down the road towards the river. It swoops down and smashes the bridge just as Roland is about to cross it and catches him up in its claws. The dragon flies away with your beloved prince.

Castle Ruins
This used to be your home. Now it is nothing more than a smoking pile of rubble. The smoke obscures your view of the stars, and the primary source of light is the burning remains of your furniture.

The only road away from the castle now ends abruptly at the river bank. The forest surrounds you thickly on all sides, except for an area to the north where the trees have been broken and scorched.

>x me
You are young and beautiful, too lovely to be described in mere words. You are, however, in dire need of a bath and a change of clothes.

You are wearing a handful of rags and a tarnished gold crown.

>i
You are carrying nothing.

>x rags
The tattered remains of your wedding gown.

>n
Perhaps you should find something more substantial to wear first.

These piles of stones and wood used to be your home. You catch a glimpse of something colorful hidden in one of the piles.

>x colorful
You can't quite make it out from here. Why don't you try digging through the rubble?

>search pile
You dig through the piles of rubble until you find a paper bag.

>x bah
You can't see any such thing.

>x bag
It's a gift bag made out of paper. It looks like it used to have polka dots on it, but now it's just scorched.

>open bag
That's not something you can open.

>look in bag
You find nothing of interest.

>empty bag
You can't see any such thing.

>wear bag
You take the paper bag.

You quickly fashion a dress out of the gift bag. It's not as fancy as you're used to, but it'll get the job done.

You strip off the remains of your wedding gown.

You slip the makeshift dress over your head and pull it down past your hips.

>x me
You are young and beautiful, too lovely to be described in mere words. You are, however, in dire need of a bath and a change of clothes.

You are wearing a gift bag that has been fashioned into a rather respectable dress and a tarnished gold crown.
