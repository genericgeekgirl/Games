This is the day you've always dreamed of. You are finally marrying the love of your life, Prince Roland.


Castle Garden
You are standing in the garden behind your family's castle. On this lovely fall evening, it is doing double duty as a wedding chapel.

Your betrothed, Roland, stands before you.

You can also see Father Alfred here.

>xyzzy
POOF! Your fairy godmother appears. She smiles at you and places a necklace around your neck. Then she fades out of view.

Father Alfred begins the ceremony, "We are gathered here today to witness the joining of two hearts." Roland smiles shyly at you.

>look necklace
A heart-shaped pendant on a gold chain.

"If anyone has a reason why these two should not be wed, speak now or forever hold your peace." You hold your breath for a second, wondering whether anyone will speak up. Fortunately, nobody does and you relax.

>i want to marry a princess
I only understood you as far as wanting to take inventory.

>put necklace on roland
(first taking Roland)
To be your lawfully wedded husband? Yes, Elizabeth. Be patient.

"Who gives this woman--" You glare icily at the minister. You are nobody's property. "Ahem. Moving on," says the minister, visibly flustered. Roland looks at you questioningly, but says nothing.

>roland is a princess
*** WARNING: Possible gap in the transcript ***That's not a verb I recognize.

>walk away
You can't see any such thing.

>find  a princess
You can't see any such thing.

>look
Castle Garden
You are standing in the garden behind your family's castle. On this lovely fall evening, it is doing double duty as a wedding chapel.

Your betrothed, Roland, stands before you.

You can also see Father Alfred here.

"Love is a wonderful thing." And so on. You're too excited to pay attention to every word.

>go in castle
That's not something you can enter.

"Elizabeth, do you take Roland to be your husband?"

>go north
You can't leave yet! The ceremony hasn't ended.

>leave
The minister is waiting for your answer. Please say "yes" or "no".

>sing
There will be plenty of time to sing later.

>yes
Of course you do!

The minister smiles at you and turns to Roland. "And, Roland, do you take Elizabeth to be your wife?"

Roland grins at you and exclaims, "I do!"

"I now pronounce you man and... dragon?!?" The minister's eyes go wide, seconds before he is incinerated by a burst of flame.

A large dragon flies overhead. The wedding guests scatter in every direction. You cower against Roland, but he pushes you towards the dragon and runs towards the road.

The dragon eats all the guests it can catch, and when it has had its fill, it smashes your castle to smithereens with its heavy tail and sets the remains on fire. You are nearly caught in a blaze of flame as you duck behind what used to be the stone wall of the garden. You are unhurt, but your fine gown snags on a rose bush and tears.

As the dragon finally turns to go, it catches sight of Roland, running down the road towards the river. It swoops down and smashes the bridge just as Roland is about to cross it and catches him up in its claws. The dragon flies away with your beloved prince.

The Paper Bag Princess
An interactive fairy tale by Adri
Release 1 / Serial number 131021 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) 

Castle Ruins
This used to be your home. Now it is nothing more than a smoking pile of rubble. The smoke obscures your view of the stars, and the primary source of light is the burning remains of your furniture.

The only road away from the castle now ends abruptly at the river bank. The forest surrounds you thickly on all sides, except for an area to the north where the trees have been broken and scorched.

>sing
You sing a few bars of a lullaby your mother used to sing to you.

>dance
*** WARNING: Possible gap in the transcript ***You practice a few steps of the Pemberletten waltz.

>die
*** WARNING: Possible gap in the transcript ***
>x rubble
These piles of stones and wood used to be your home. You catch a glimpse of something colorful hidden in one of the piles.

>make dress
How do you intend to do that?

>search rubble
You dig through the piles of rubble until you find a paper bag.

>make dress
You take the paper bag.

You quickly fashion a dress out of the gift bag. It's not as fancy as you're used to, but it'll get the job done.

You strip off the remains of your wedding gown and discard them in a pile of rubble.

You slip the makeshift dress over your head and pull it down past your hips.

>plugh
The necklace suddenly begins to glow.

>go north

Burnt Forest
There's a trail of burned trees and what appear to be teeth leading to the northeast. One tree in particular catches your eye.

>x tree
You examine the tree more closely. Someone has carved "PLUGH" into the trunk.

There is a large branch propped up against the base of the tree.

>take branch
You take the branch.

You are now alone in the dark. You remember the stories your father used to tell you about Grues, but you're reasonably certain they did not live in forests.

>grues
That's not a verb I recognize.

Dark Forest
It is so dark that you can barely see the trees that you know surround you.

>go north
You stumble and cannot find your way. The necklace vibrates gently against your skin, but remains unlit.

You finally emerge from the forest.

Outside the Dragon's Cave
You are standing before a large cave. The entrance has been blocked by a large wooden door.

>knock
*** WARNING: Possible gap in the transcript ***(the cave door)
You grab the knocker and bang on the door.

The door opens and the dragon sticks its nose through the opening. It says, "Well, a princess! I love to eat princesses, but I have already eaten a whole castle today. I am a very tired dragon. Come back tomorrow." 

Then it slams the door in your face.

>wait
Time passes.

>shout
Shout! Shout! Let it all out!

>marry princess
You can't see any such thing.

>sing
*** WARNING: Possible gap in the transcript ***You sing a few bars of a lullaby your mother used to sing to you.

>knock
(the cave door)
You bang on the door again.

The dragon sticks its nose out the door and says, "I am sure you are very delicious, but I am rather tired and stuffed. Please do come back tomorrow."

This time, however, he does not immediately return to his cave.

>shout
"Wait!" you exclaim.

Surprised, the dragon steps entirely out of the cave, nudging the door shut with its tail.

>sing
You sing a few bars of a lullaby your mother used to sing to you.

The dragon seems to relax at the sound.

>sing
You sing a few bars of a lullaby your mother used to sing to you.

It seems to be having the desired effect on the dragon.

>sing

It seems to be having the desired effect on the dragon.

The dragon is so tired that he falls fast asleep.

>sing
You sing a few bars of a lullaby your mother used to sing to you.

>dance
You practice a few steps of the Pemberletten waltz.

>go in
(first opening the cave door)
You step over the dragon and open the door to the cave.

The Dragon's Cave
This is where the dragon lives. Piles of treasure fill the room, reflecting light in every direction.

Your betrothed, Roland, stands before you.

Roland looks at you and says, "Elizabeth, you are a mess! You smell like ashes, your hair is all tangled, and you are wearing a dirty paper bag. Come back when you are dressed like a real princess."

>slap roland
*** WARNING: Possible gap in the transcript ***You slap Roland!

"Roland," you say, "your clothes are really pretty, and your hair is very neat. You look like a real prince, but you are also a real toad."

You turn around and walk out the door.



    *** And Elizabeth lived happily ever after! ***
