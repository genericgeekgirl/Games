* testing:
- burn all the things
- talk to the dragon about all sorts of things

Give things to Roland at the end?

Some cool stuff to chat about:
* Treasure -- might be fun to see the dragon really go in-depth here
* Trogdor / other popular (or subculture) dragons... are they related?
* How do humans taste? Recipes?
* What else is in the forest?
* Dragon's hobbies (pretty self-expanitory)
* Dragon games (perhaps not so much)
* Dungeons / Dragon hideaways
* Godzilla / kaiju stuff
