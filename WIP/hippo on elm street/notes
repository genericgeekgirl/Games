scare off partygoers?
find a costume
eat the candy


[ToDo]
[House is scary. Flashing lights, smoke machine. Lots of nameless, faceless people who are screaming and wearing scary costumes.]
[Fake spiderwebs with a giant spider. They can be climbed to reach something. What?]
[Maybe once you get the first piece of candy you decide that you have a new goal. Maybe you can climb the web and float through the air with the napkin to reach something else.]
[need to use napkin first though, because it becomes gross. Need another way to get up, maybe.]
