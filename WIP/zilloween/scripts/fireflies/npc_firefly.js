var description = "The perfect alliance of science and nature, the dowdy brown coat of the firefly when landed belies their beauty when in flight: a heart of gold, a tiny buzzy fizzling flying flame. Thought to have washed up on the banks of the mythological River Tam and taken flight eleventy billion eras ago, and never rested or run out of gas since. The firefly's glowing essence can be used to create crystals.";
