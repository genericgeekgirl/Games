* just make a maze with a set path, 16 or so rooms in a grid, one correct path, otherwise random?]

I was worried going into the forest that my light source would go out & I'd have liked a bit more indication of what would happen. E.g. your fairy godmother helped you, and maybe she should say 'It will last just long enough' or something.

That allows for narrative which I think the player would enjoy when stuck in the forest e.g. 'You have to be close to the dragon's cave.'

I got stuck finding what to ask the dragon about as well, but I could and should have figured it out. I'd have liked to see hints in response to this as well as an AMUSING section at the end--because I have a feeling this game put various touches I missed, and I want to see them.

Also, Rolande is still being stored as a subject as a "him" and not a "her"--that is, if you say ">x rolande >kiss her" the game doesn't know who "her" is supposed to be referring to, but ">x rolande >kiss him" works.

I do think that you could cue the "ask dragon about fire" and "ask dragon about flight" a little better, maybe in the response to "talk to dragon". I pretty much only figured those out because I know the story, and even then I had to poke at it a bit to get the right wording.

Found it curious that "put out fire" yields "you put out the flames", as that 1) doesn't actually happen and 2) if it did, at that point it would make the game unwinnable.

The second problem was right at the end with the conversation with the dragon. I had trouble with that (as others did) identifying the triggers I needed, which has again been much improved in the update, so all is now smooth. But it would have been really cool if the dragon were equipped, beyond the few topics that really matter, with a wide range of subjects. It would have added interactivity, which the story otherwise somewhat lacks, and character and, I think, charm.

"I found it unfortunate that Elizabeth talks the dragon into incinerating 150 forests." Hahaha, maybe I can do something about this..

"Yes," says the dragon. Boastful fellow, isn't he?

>yes
That was a rhetorical question.



>ask dragon about roland
The dragon says, "Oh, yes. I love to eat royals. But I have already eaten a whole castle today, so I am saving your prince for later."

"Where is he?" you cry.

"I cannot tell you that," says the dragon, although it casts a nervous look towards the cave.



>ask about castle
The dragon says, "That's very kind of you to offer, but I have already eaten a whole castle today."

"That was my home!" you shout.

The dragon shrugs. It doesn't seem particularly inclined to apologize.
