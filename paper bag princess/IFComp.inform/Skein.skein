This is the day you&apos;ve always dreamed of. You are finally marrying the love of your life, Prince Roland.


Castle Garden
You are standing in the garden behind your family&apos;s castle. On this lovely fall evening, it is doing double duty as a wedding chapel.

Your betrothed, Roland, stands before you.

You can also see Father Alfred here.

(first taking the paper bag)
You quickly fashion a dress out of the gift bag. It&apos;s not as fancy as you&apos;re used to, but it&apos;ll get the job done.

You strip off the remains of your wedding gown and discard them in a pile of rubble.

First Forest
There&apos;s a trail of burned trees and horses&apos; teeth leading to the northeast.

Cave Exterior
(the Cave Door)
You knock on the Cave Door.

The dragon opens the door and tells you to beat it.

You strip off the remains of your wedding gown and discard them in a pile of rubble.

You grab the knocker and bang on the door.

Father Alfred begins the ceremony, &quot;We are gathered here today to witness the joining of two hearts.&quot; Roland smiles shyly at you.

You beam happily at Roland.

&quot;If anyone has a reason why these two should not be wed, speak now or forever hold your peace.&quot; You hold your breath for a second, wondering whether anyone will speak up. Fortunately, nobody does and you relax.

You beam happily at Roland.

&quot;Who gives this woman--&quot; You glare icily at the minister. You are nobody&apos;s property. &quot;Ahem. Moving on,&quot; says the minister, visibly flustered. Roland looks at you questioningly, but says nothing.

You beam happily at Roland.

&quot;Love is a wonderful thing.&quot; And so on. You&apos;re too excited to pay attention to every word.

You quickly fashion a dress out of the gift bag. It&apos;s not as fancy as you&apos;re used to, but it&apos;ll get the job done.

You can see now the dragon here.

(the Cave Door)
You grab the knocker and bang on the door.

&quot;Well, a princess! I love to eat princesses, but I have already eaten a whole castle today. I am a very busy dragon. Come back tomorrow.&quot;

The dragon sticks his nose out the door and says, &quot;Well, a princess! I love to eat princesses, but I have already eaten a whole castle today. I am a very busy dragon. Come back tomorrow.&quot;

Roland grins at you and exclaims, &quot;I do!&quot;.

&quot;I now pronounce you man and... dragon?!?&quot; The minister&apos;s eyes go wide, seconds before he is incinerated by a burst of flame.

A large dragon flies overhead. The wedding guests scatter in every direction. You cower against Roland, but he pushes you towards the dragon and runs towards the road.

The dragon eats all the guests it can catch, and when it has had its fill, it smashes your castle to smithereens with its heavy tail and sets the remains on fire. You are nearly caught in a blaze of flame as you duck behind what used to be the stone wall of the garden. You are unhurt, but your fine gown snags on a rose bush and tears.

As the dragon finally turns to go, it catches sight of Roland, running down the road towards the river. It swoops down and smashes the bridge just as Roland is about to cross it and catches him up in its claws. The dragon flies away with your beloved prince.

Castle Ruins
This used to be your home. Now it is nothing more than a smoking pile of rubble. The smoke obscures your view of the stars, and the primary source of light is the burning remains of your furniture.

The only road away from the castle now ends abruptly at the river bank. The forest surrounds you thickly on all sides, except for an area to the north where the trees have been broken and scorched.

The minister smiles at you and turns to Roland. &quot;And, Roland, do you take Elizabeth to be your wife?&quot;

Roland grins at you and exclaims, &quot;I do!&quot;.

&quot;I now pronounce you man and... dragon?!?&quot; The minister&apos;s eyes go wide, seconds before he is incinerated by a burst of flame.

A large dragon flies overhead. The wedding guests scatter in every direction. You cower against Roland, but he pushes you towards the dragon and runs towards the road.

The dragon eats all the guests it can catch, and when it has had its fill, it smashes your castle to smithereens with its heavy tail and sets the remains on fire. You are nearly caught in a blaze of flame as you duck behind what used to be the stone wall of the garden. You are unhurt, but your fine gown snags on a rose bush and tears.

As the dragon finally turns to go, it catches sight of Roland, running down the road towards the river. It swoops down and smashes the bridge just as Roland is about to cross it and catches him up in its claws. The dragon flies away with your beloved prince.

Castle Ruins
This used to be your home. Now it is nothing more than a smoking pile of rubble. The smoke obscures your view of the stars, and the primary source of light is the burning remains of your furniture.

The only road away from the castle now ends abruptly at the river bank. The forest surrounds you thickly on all sides, except for an area to the north where the trees have been broken and scorched.

You glare icily at the minister. You are nobody&apos;s property. &quot;Ahem. Moving on..&quot; Roland furrows his brow, but says nothing.

(first taking the paper bag)
You quickly fashion a dress out of the gift bag. It&apos;s not as fancy as you&apos;re used to, but it&apos;ll get the job done.

You strip off the remains of your wedding gown and discard them in a pile of rubble.

First Forest
There&apos;s a trail of burned trees and horses&apos; teeth leading to the northeast.

Cave Exterior
(the Cave Door)
You grab the knocker and bang on the door.

The dragon sticks his nose out the door and says, &quot;Well, a princess! I love to eat princesses, but I have already eaten a whole castle today. I am a very busy dragon. Come back tomorrow.&quot;

Then he slams the door.

You grab the knocker and bang on the door again.

The dragon sticks his nose out the door and says, &quot;Well, a princess! I love to eat princesses, but I have already eaten a whole castle today. I am a very busy dragon. Come back tomorrow.&quot;

This time he pauses a moment before slamming the door.

You grab the knocker and bang on the door.

The dragon sticks his nose out the door and says, &quot;Well, a princess! I love to eat princesses, but I have already eaten a whole castle today. I am a very busy dragon. Come back tomorrow.&quot;

You grab the knocker and bang on the door again.

The dragon sticks his nose out the door and says, &quot;Well, a princess! I love to eat princesses, but I have already eaten a whole castle today. I am a very busy dragon. Come back tomorrow.&quot; 
This time he pauses a moment before slamming the door.

The dragon sticks his nose out the door and says, &quot;Well, a princess! I love to eat princesses, but I have already eaten a whole castle today. I am a very busy dragon. Come back tomorrow.&quot;

You grab the knocker and bang on the door again.

The dragon sticks his nose out the door and says, &quot;Well, a princess! I love to eat princesses, but I have already eaten a whole castle today. I am a very busy dragon. Come back tomorrow.&quot;

Burnt Forest
There&apos;s a trail of burned trees and horses&apos; teeth leading to the northeast. One tree in particular catches your eye.

The trail seems to be leading northeast.

You find a large branch lying on the trail.

Taken.

You fashion a torch from the branch and the remains of your wedding gown.

Roland grins at you and exclaims, &quot;I do!&quot;.

&quot;I now pronounce you man and... dragon?!?&quot; The minister&apos;s eyes go wide, seconds before he is incinerated by a burst of flame.

A large dragon flies overhead. The wedding guests scatter in every direction. You cower against Roland, but he pushes you towards the dragon and runs towards the road.

The dragon eats all the guests it can catch, and when it has had its fill, it smashes your castle to smithereens with its heavy tail and sets the remains on fire. You are nearly caught in a blaze of flame as you duck behind what used to be the stone wall of the garden. You are unhurt, but your fine gown snags on a rose bush and tears.

As the dragon finally turns to go, it catches sight of Roland, running down the road towards the river. It swoops down and smashes the bridge just as Roland is about to cross it and catches him up in its claws. The dragon flies away with your beloved prince.

Castle Ruins
This used to be your home. Now it is nothing more than a smoking pile of rubble. The smoke obscures your view of the stars, and the primary source of light is the burning remains of your furniture.

The only road away from the castle now ends abruptly at the river bank. The forest surrounds you thickly on all sides, except for an area to the north where the trees have been broken and scorched.

Castle Ruins
This used to be your home. Now it is nothing more than a smoking pile of rubble. The smoke obscures your view of the stars, and the primary source of light is the burning remains of your furniture.

The only road away from the castle now ends abruptly at the river bank. The forest surrounds you thickly on all sides, except for an area to the north where the trees have been broken and scorched.

&gt;[23] light torch
You light the torch with the flames.

Castle Ruins
This used to be your home. Now it is nothing more than a smoking pile of rubble. The smoke obscures your view of the stars, and the primary source of light is the burning remains of your furniture.

The only road away from the castle now ends abruptly at the river bank. The forest surrounds you thickly on all sides, except for an area to the north where the trees have been broken and scorched.

You quickly fashion a dress out of the gift bag. It&apos;s not as fancy as you&apos;re used to, but it&apos;ll get the job done.

You strip off the remains of your wedding gown.

You slip the makeshift dress over your head and pull it down past your hips.

Burnt Forest
There&apos;s a trail of burned trees and what appear to be teeth leading to the northeast. One tree in particular catches your eye.

&quot;Elizabeth, do you take Roland to be your husband?&quot;

&gt;[7] yes
Of course you do!

The minister smiles at you and turns to Roland. &quot;And, Roland, do you take Elizabeth to be your wife?&quot;

Roland grins at you and exclaims, &quot;I do!&quot;

&quot;I now pronounce you man and... dragon?!?&quot; The minister&apos;s eyes go wide, seconds before he is incinerated by a burst of flame.

A large dragon flies overhead. The wedding guests scatter in every direction. You cower against Roland, but he pushes you towards the dragon and runs towards the road.

The dragon eats all the guests it can catch, and when it has had its fill, it smashes your castle to smithereens with its heavy tail and sets the remains on fire. You are nearly caught in a blaze of flame as you duck behind what used to be the stone wall of the garden. You are unhurt, but your fine gown snags on a rose bush and tears.

As the dragon finally turns to go, it catches sight of Roland, running down the road towards the river. It swoops down and smashes the bridge just as Roland is about to cross it and catches him up in its claws. The dragon flies away with your beloved prince.

The Paper Bag Princess
An interactive fairy tale by Adri
Release 1 / Serial number 131005 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) SD

Castle Ruins
This used to be your home. Now it is nothing more than a smoking pile of rubble. The smoke obscures your view of the stars, and the primary source of light is the burning remains of your furniture.

The only road away from the castle now ends abruptly at the river bank. The forest surrounds you thickly on all sides, except for an area to the north where the trees have been broken and scorched.

You dig through the piles of rubble until you find a paper bag.

You quickly fashion a dress out of the gift bag. It&apos;s not as fancy as you&apos;re used to, but it&apos;ll get the job done.

You strip off the remains of your wedding gown.

You slip the makeshift dress over your head and pull it down past your hips.

I&apos;m not sure I can help you with this one.&quot; She pauses and rummages around in her pockets, pulling out a vial. She hands it to you. &quot;This is the best I can do. Use it wisely.&quot; Then she vanishes, as quickly as she appeared.

Then it slams the door in your face.

You bang on the door again.

The dragon sticks its nose out the door and says, &quot;I am sure you are very delicious, but I am rather tired and stuffed. Please do come back tomorrow.&quot;

You say, &quot;Dragon, is it true that you can fly around the world in just ten seconds?&quot;

&quot;Why, yes,&quot; says the dragon, and he jumps up and flies around the world in just ten seconds. He seems very tired when he returns.

This is the day you&apos;ve always dreamed of. You are finally marrying the love of your life, Prince Roland.


Castle Garden
You are standing in the garden behind your family&apos;s castle. On this lovely fall evening, it is doing double duty as a wedding chapel.

Your betrothed, Roland, stands before you.

You can also see Father Alfred here.

You beam happily at Roland.

&quot;If anyone has a reason why these two should not be wed, speak now or forever hold your peace.&quot; You hold your breath for a second, wondering whether anyone will speak up. Fortunately, nobody does and you relax.

&gt;[3] z
You beam happily at Roland.

&quot;Who gives this woman--&quot; You glare icily at the minister. You are nobody&apos;s property. &quot;Ahem. Moving on,&quot; says the minister, visibly flustered. Roland looks at you questioningly, but says nothing.

&gt;[4] z
You beam happily at Roland.

&quot;Love is a wonderful thing.&quot; And so on. You&apos;re too excited to pay attention to every word.

&gt;[5] z
You beam happily at Roland.

&quot;Elizabeth, do you take Roland to be your husband?&quot;

&gt;[6] z
The minister is waiting for your answer. Please say &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;.

&gt;[7] yes
Of course you do!

The minister smiles at you and turns to Roland. &quot;And, Roland, do you take Elizabeth to be your wife?&quot;

Roland grins at you and exclaims, &quot;I do!&quot;

&quot;I now pronounce you man and... dragon?!?&quot; The minister&apos;s eyes go wide, seconds before he is incinerated by a burst of flame.

A large dragon flies overhead. The wedding guests scatter in every direction. You cower against Roland, but he pushes you towards the dragon and runs towards the road.

The dragon eats all the guests it can catch, and when it has had its fill, it smashes your castle to smithereens with its heavy tail and sets the remains on fire. You are nearly caught in a blaze of flame as you duck behind what used to be the stone wall of the garden. You are unhurt, but your fine gown snags on a rose bush and tears.

As the dragon finally turns to go, it catches sight of Roland, running down the road towards the river. It swoops down and smashes the bridge just as Roland is about to cross it and catches him up in its claws. The dragon flies away with your beloved prince.

I&apos;m not sure I can help you with this one.&quot; She pauses and rummages around in her pockets, pulling out a vial. She hands it to you. &quot;This is the best I can do.

Then it slams the door in your face.

You bang on the door again.

The dragon sticks its nose out the door and says, &quot;I am sure you are very delicious, but I am rather tired and stuffed. Please do come back tomorrow.&quot;

This time, however, he does not immediately return to his cave.

&quot;Why, yes,&quot; says the dragon, and he jumps up and flies around the world in just ten seconds. He seems very tired when he returns.


Were you impressed by that display?

The Paper Bag Princess
An interactive fairy tale by Adri
Release 1 / Serial number 130928 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) SD

Castle Ruins
This used to be your home. Now it is nothing more than a smoking pile of rubble. The smoke obscures your view of the stars, and the primary source of light is the burning remains of your furniture.

The only road away from the castle now ends abruptly at the river bank. The forest surrounds you thickly on all sides, except for an area to the north where the trees have been broken and scorched.

You quickly fashion a dress out of the gift bag. It&apos;s not as fancy as you&apos;re used to, but it&apos;ll get the job done.

You strip off the remains of your wedding gown.

You slip the makeshift dress over your head and pull it down past your hips.

You beam happily at Roland.

&quot;If anyone has a reason why these two should not be wed, speak now or forever hold your peace.&quot; You hold your breath for a second, wondering whether anyone will speak up. Fortunately, nobody does and you relax.

You beam happily at Roland.

&quot;Who gives this woman--&quot; You glare icily at the minister. You are nobody&apos;s property. &quot;Ahem. Moving on,&quot; says the minister, visibly flustered. Roland looks at you questioningly, but says nothing.

You beam happily at Roland.

&quot;Love is a wonderful thing.&quot; And so on. You&apos;re too excited to pay attention to every word.

You beam happily at Roland.

&quot;Elizabeth, do you take Roland to be your husband?&quot;

The minister is waiting for your answer. Please say &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;.

Roland grins at you and exclaims, &quot;I do!&quot;.

&quot;I now pronounce you man and... dragon?!?&quot; The minister&apos;s eyes go wide, seconds before he is incinerated by a burst of flame.

A large dragon flies overhead. The wedding guests scatter in every direction. You cower against Roland, but he pushes you towards the dragon and runs towards the road.

The dragon eats all the guests it can catch, and when it has had its fill, it smashes your castle to smithereens with its heavy tail and sets the remains on fire. You are nearly caught in a blaze of flame as you duck behind what used to be the stone wall of the garden. You are unhurt, but your fine gown snags on a rose bush and tears.

As the dragon finally turns to go, it catches sight of Roland, running down the road towards the river. It swoops down and smashes the bridge just as Roland is about to cross it and catches him up in its claws. The dragon flies away with your beloved prince.

Father Alfred begins the ceremony, &quot;We are gathered here today to witness the joining of two hearts.&quot; Roland smiles shyly at you.

You beam happily at Roland.

&quot;If anyone has a reason why these two should not be wed, speak now or forever hold your peace.&quot; You hold your breath for a second, wondering whether anyone will speak up. Fortunately, nobody does and you relax.

You beam happily at Roland.

&quot;Who gives this woman--&quot; You glare icily at the minister. You are nobody&apos;s property. &quot;Ahem. Moving on,&quot; says the minister, visibly flustered. Roland looks at you questioningly, but says nothing.

You beam happily at Roland.

&quot;Love is a wonderful thing.&quot; And so on. You&apos;re too excited to pay attention to every word.

You beam happily at Roland.

&quot;Elizabeth, do you take Roland to be your husband?&quot;

The minister is waiting for your answer. Please say &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;.

Of course you do!

The minister smiles at you and turns to Roland. &quot;And, Roland, do you take Elizabeth to be your wife?&quot;

Roland grins at you and exclaims, &quot;I do!&quot;.

&quot;I now pronounce you man and... dragon?!?&quot; The minister&apos;s eyes go wide, seconds before he is incinerated by a burst of flame.

A large dragon flies overhead. The wedding guests scatter in every direction. You cower against Roland, but he pushes you towards the dragon and runs towards the road.

The dragon eats all the guests it can catch, and when it has had its fill, it smashes your castle to smithereens with its heavy tail and sets the remains on fire. You are nearly caught in a blaze of flame as you duck behind what used to be the stone wall of the garden. You are unhurt, but your fine gown snags on a rose bush and tears.

As the dragon finally turns to go, it catches sight of Roland, running down the road towards the river. It swoops down and smashes the bridge just as Roland is about to cross it and catches him up in its claws. The dragon flies away with your beloved prince.

Castle Ruins
This used to be your home. Now it is nothing more than a smoking pile of rubble. The smoke obscures your view of the stars, and the primary source of light is the burning remains of your furniture.

The only road away from the castle now ends abruptly at the river bank. The forest surrounds you thickly on all sides, except for an area to the north where the trees have been broken and scorched.

Castle Ruins
This used to be your home. Now it is nothing more than a smoking pile of rubble. The smoke obscures your view of the stars, and the primary source of light is the burning remains of your furniture.

The only road away from the castle now ends abruptly at the river bank. The forest surrounds you thickly on all sides, except for an area to the north where the trees have been broken and scorched.

You strip off the remains of your wedding gown.

You slip the makeshift dress over your head and pull it down past your hips.

Burnt Forest

Castle Garden
You are standing in the garden behind your family&apos;s castle. On this lovely fall evening, it is doing double duty as a wedding chapel.

Your betrothed, Roland, stands before you.

You can also see Father Alfred here.

You beam happily at Roland.

Father Alfred begins the ceremony, &quot;We are gathered here today to witness the joining of two hearts.&quot; Roland smiles shyly at you.

&gt;[3] z
You beam happily at Roland.

&quot;If anyone has a reason why these two should not be wed, speak now or forever hold your peace.&quot; You hold your breath for a second, wondering whether anyone will speak up. Fortunately, nobody does and you relax.

&gt;[4] z
You beam happily at Roland.

&quot;Who gives this woman--&quot; You glare icily at the minister. You are nobody&apos;s property. &quot;Ahem. Moving on,&quot; says the minister, visibly flustered. Roland looks at you questioningly, but says nothing.

&gt;[5] z
You beam happily at Roland.

&quot;Love is a wonderful thing.&quot; And so on. You&apos;re too excited to pay attention to every word.

&gt;[6] z
You beam happily at Roland.

&quot;Elizabeth, do you take Roland to be your husband?&quot;

&gt;[7] yes
Of course you do!

The minister smiles at you and turns to Roland. &quot;And, Roland, do you take Elizabeth to be your wife?&quot;

Roland grins at you and exclaims, &quot;I do!&quot;

&quot;I now pronounce you man and... dragon?!?&quot; The minister&apos;s eyes go wide, seconds before he is incinerated by a burst of flame.

A large dragon flies overhead. The wedding guests scatter in every direction. You cower against Roland, but he pushes you towards the dragon and runs towards the road.

The dragon eats all the guests it can catch, and when it has had its fill, it smashes your castle to smithereens with its heavy tail and sets the remains on fire. You are nearly caught in a blaze of flame as you duck behind what used to be the stone wall of the garden. You are unhurt, but your fine gown snags on a rose bush and tears.

As the dragon finally turns to go, it catches sight of Roland, running down the road towards the river. It swoops down and smashes the bridge just as Roland is about to cross it and catches him up in its claws. The dragon flies away with your beloved prince.

Castle Ruins
This used to be your home. Now it is nothing more than a smoking pile of rubble. The smoke obscures your view of the stars, and the primary source of light is the burning remains of your furniture.

The only road away from the castle now ends abruptly at the river bank. The forest surrounds you thickly on all sides, except for an area to the north where the trees have been broken and scorched.

&quot;Why, yes,&quot; says the dragon, and he jumps up and flies around the world in just ten seconds. He seems very tired when he returns.

A large dragon flies overhead. The wedding guests scatter in every direction. You cower against Roland, but he pushes you towards the dragon and runs towards the road.

The dragon eats all the guests it can catch, and when it has had its fill, it smashes your castle to smithereens with its heavy tail and sets the remains on fire. You are nearly caught in a blaze of flame as you duck behind what used to be the stone wall of the garden. You are unhurt, but your fine gown snags on a rose bush and tears.

As the dragon finally turns to go, it catches sight of Roland, running down the road towards the river. It swoops down and smashes the bridge just as Roland is about to cross it and catches him up in its claws. The dragon flies away with your beloved prince.

The dragon eats all the guests it can catch, and when it has had its fill, it smashes your castle to smithereens with its heavy tail and sets the remains on fire. You are nearly caught in a blaze of flame as you duck behind what used to be the stone wall of the garden. You are unhurt, but your fine gown snags on a rose bush and tears.

As the dragon finally turns to go, it catches sight of Roland, running down the road towards the river. It swoops down and smashes the bridge just as Roland is about to cross it and catches him up in its claws. The dragon flies away with your beloved prince.

Castle Ruins
This used to be your home. Now it is nothing more than a smoking pile of rubble. The smoke obscures your view of the stars, and the primary source of light is the burning remains of your furniture.

The only road away from the castle now ends abruptly at the river bank. The forest surrounds you thickly on all sides, except for an area to the north where the trees have been broken and scorched.

You slip the makeshift dress over your head and pull it down past your hips.

I&apos;m not sure I can help you with this one.&quot; She pauses and rummages around in her pockets, pulling out a vial. She hands it to you. &quot;This is the best I can do. Use it wisely.&quot; Then she vanishes, as quickly as she appeared.

Then he slams the door in your face.

This used to be your home. Now it is nothing more than a smoking pile of rubble. The smoke obscures your view of the stars, and the primary source of light is the burning remains of your furniture.

The only road away from the castle now ends abruptly at the river bank. The forest surrounds you thickly on all sides, except for an area to the north where the trees have been broken and scorched.

Father Alfred begins the ceremony, &quot;We are gathered here today to witness the joining of two hearts.&quot; Roland smiles shyly at you.

&gt;[2] z
You beam happily at Roland.

&quot;If anyone has a reason why these two should not be wed, speak now or forever hold your peace.&quot; You hold your breath for a second, wondering whether anyone will speak up. Fortunately, nobody does and you relax.

&gt;[3] z
You beam happily at Roland.

&quot;Who gives this woman--&quot; You glare icily at the minister. You are nobody&apos;s property. &quot;Ahem. Moving on,&quot; says the minister, visibly flustered. Roland looks at you questioningly, but says nothing.

&gt;[4] z
You beam happily at Roland.

&quot;Love is a wonderful thing.&quot; And so on. You&apos;re too excited to pay attention to every word.

&gt;[5] z
You beam happily at Roland.

&quot;Elizabeth, do you take Roland to be your husband?&quot;

&gt;[6] yes
Of course you do!

The minister smiles at you and turns to Roland. &quot;And, Roland, do you take Elizabeth to be your wife?&quot;

Roland grins at you and exclaims, &quot;I do!&quot;

&quot;I now pronounce you man and... dragon?!?&quot; The minister&apos;s eyes go wide, seconds before he is incinerated by a burst of flame.

A large dragon flies overhead. The wedding guests scatter in every direction. You cower against Roland, but he pushes you towards the dragon and runs towards the road.

The dragon eats all the guests it can catch, and when it has had its fill, it smashes your castle to smithereens with its heavy tail and sets the remains on fire. You are nearly caught in a blaze of flame as you duck behind what used to be the stone wall of the garden. You are unhurt, but your fine gown snags on a rose bush and tears.

As the dragon finally turns to go, it catches sight of Roland, running down the road towards the river. It swoops down and smashes the bridge just as Roland is about to cross it and catches him up in its claws. The dragon flies away with your beloved prince.
