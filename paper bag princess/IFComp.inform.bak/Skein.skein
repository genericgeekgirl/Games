This is the day you&apos;ve always dreamed of. You are finally marrying the love of your life, Prince Roland.


Castle Garden
You are standing in the garden behind your family&apos;s castle. On this lovely fall evening, it is doing double duty as a wedding chapel.

Your betrothed, Roland, stands before you.

You can also see Father Alfred here.

(first taking the paper bag)
You quickly fashion a dress out of the gift bag. It&apos;s not as fancy as you&apos;re used to, but it&apos;ll get the job done.

You strip off the remains of your wedding gown and discard them in a pile of rubble.

First Forest
There&apos;s a trail of burned trees and horses&apos; teeth leading to the northeast.

Cave Exterior
(the Cave Door)
You knock on the Cave Door.

The dragon opens the door and tells you to beat it.

You strip off the remains of your wedding gown and discard them in a pile of rubble.

Father Alfred begins the ceremony, &quot;We are gathered here today to witness the joining of two hearts.&quot; Roland smiles shyly at you.

You beam happily at Roland.

&quot;If anyone has a reason why these two should not be wed, speak now or forever hold your peace.&quot; You hold your breath for a second, wondering whether anyone will speak up. Fortunately, nobody does and you relax.

You beam happily at Roland.

&quot;Who gives this woman--&quot; You glare icily at the minister. You are nobody&apos;s property. &quot;Ahem. Moving on,&quot; says the minister, visibly flustered. Roland looks at you questioningly, but says nothing.

You beam happily at Roland.

&quot;Love is a wonderful thing.&quot; And so on. You&apos;re too excited to pay attention to every word.

You quickly fashion a dress out of the gift bag. It&apos;s not as fancy as you&apos;re used to, but it&apos;ll get the job done.

You can see now the dragon here.

(the Cave Door)
You grab the knocker and bang on the door.

Roland grins at you and exclaims, &quot;I do!&quot;.

&quot;I now pronounce you man and... dragon?!?&quot; The minister&apos;s eyes go wide, seconds before he is incinerated by a burst of flame.

A large dragon flies overhead. The wedding guests scatter in every direction. You cower against Roland, but he pushes you towards the dragon and runs towards the road.

The dragon eats all the guests it can catch, and when it has had its fill, it smashes your castle to smithereens with its heavy tail and sets the remains on fire. You are nearly caught in a blaze of flame as you duck behind what used to be the stone wall of the garden. You are unhurt, but your fine gown snags on a rose bush and tears.

As the dragon finally turns to go, it catches sight of Roland, running down the road towards the river. It swoops down and smashes the bridge just as Roland is about to cross it and catches him up in its claws. The dragon flies away with your beloved prince.

Castle Ruins
This used to be your home. Now it is nothing more than a smoking pile of rubble. The smoke obscures your view of the stars, and the primary source of light is the burning remains of your furniture.

The only road away from the castle now ends abruptly at the river bank. The forest surrounds you thickly on all sides, except for an area to the north where the trees have been broken and scorched.

The minister smiles at you and turns to Roland. &quot;And, Roland, do you take Elizabeth to be your wife?&quot;

Roland grins at you and exclaims, &quot;I do!&quot;.

&quot;I now pronounce you man and... dragon?!?&quot; The minister&apos;s eyes go wide, seconds before he is incinerated by a burst of flame.

A large dragon flies overhead. The wedding guests scatter in every direction. You cower against Roland, but he pushes you towards the dragon and runs towards the road.

The dragon eats all the guests it can catch, and when it has had its fill, it smashes your castle to smithereens with its heavy tail and sets the remains on fire. You are nearly caught in a blaze of flame as you duck behind what used to be the stone wall of the garden. You are unhurt, but your fine gown snags on a rose bush and tears.

As the dragon finally turns to go, it catches sight of Roland, running down the road towards the river. It swoops down and smashes the bridge just as Roland is about to cross it and catches him up in its claws. The dragon flies away with your beloved prince.

Castle Ruins
This used to be your home. Now it is nothing more than a smoking pile of rubble. The smoke obscures your view of the stars, and the primary source of light is the burning remains of your furniture.

The only road away from the castle now ends abruptly at the river bank. The forest surrounds you thickly on all sides, except for an area to the north where the trees have been broken and scorched.

You hold your breath for a second, wondering whether anyone will speak up. Nobody does. You visibly relax.

You beam happily at Roland.

&quot;Who gives this woman--&quot;

You glare icily at the minister. You are nobody&apos;s property. &quot;Ahem. Moving on..&quot; Roland furrows his brow, but says nothing.

(first taking the paper bag)
You quickly fashion a dress out of the gift bag. It&apos;s not as fancy as you&apos;re used to, but it&apos;ll get the job done.

You strip off the remains of your wedding gown and discard them in a pile of rubble.

First Forest
There&apos;s a trail of burned trees and horses&apos; teeth leading to the northeast.

Cave Exterior
(the Cave Door)
You grab the knocker and bang on the door.

The dragon sticks his nose out the door and says, &quot;Well, a princess! I love to eat princesses, but I have already eaten a whole castle today. I am a very busy dragon. Come back tomorrow.&quot;

Then he slams the door.

You grab the knocker and bang on the door again.

The dragon sticks his nose out the door and says, &quot;Well, a princess! I love to eat princesses, but I have already eaten a whole castle today. I am a very busy dragon. Come back tomorrow.&quot;

This time he pauses a moment before slamming the door.

You drop the vial. It bounces harmlessly on the ground. The lid snaps shut in the process, and you don&apos;t lose more than a few drops of the oily black liquid.

Burnt Forest
There&apos;s a trail of burned trees and horses&apos; teeth leading to the northeast. One tree in particular catches your eye.

The trail seems to be leading northeast.

You find a large branch lying on the trail.

Taken.

You fashion a torch from the branch and the remains of your wedding gown.

Father Alfred begins the ceremony, &quot;We are gathered here today to witness the joining of two hearts.&quot; Roland smiles shyly at you.

You beam happily at Roland.

&quot;If anyone has a reason why these two should not be wed, speak now or forever hold your peace.&quot; You hold your breath for a second, wondering whether anyone will speak up. Fortunately, nobody does and you relax.

You beam happily at Roland.

&quot;Who gives this woman--&quot; You glare icily at the minister. You are nobody&apos;s property. &quot;Ahem. Moving on,&quot; says the minister, visibly flustered. Roland looks at you questioningly, but says nothing.

You beam happily at Roland.

&quot;Love is a wonderful thing.&quot; And so on. You&apos;re too excited to pay attention to every word.

You beam happily at Roland.

&quot;Elizabeth, do you take Roland to be your husband?&quot;

The minister smiles at you and turns to Roland. &quot;And, Roland, do you take Elizabeth to be your wife?&quot;

Roland grins at you and exclaims, &quot;I do!&quot;.

&quot;I now pronounce you man and... dragon?!?&quot; The minister&apos;s eyes go wide, seconds before he is incinerated by a burst of flame.

A large dragon flies overhead. The wedding guests scatter in every direction. You cower against Roland, but he pushes you towards the dragon and runs towards the road.

The dragon eats all the guests it can catch, and when it has had its fill, it smashes your castle to smithereens with its heavy tail and sets the remains on fire. You are nearly caught in a blaze of flame as you duck behind what used to be the stone wall of the garden. You are unhurt, but your fine gown snags on a rose bush and tears.

As the dragon finally turns to go, it catches sight of Roland, running down the road towards the river. It swoops down and smashes the bridge just as Roland is about to cross it and catches him up in its claws. The dragon flies away with your beloved prince.

The Paper Bag Princess
An interactive fairy tale by Adri
Release 1 / Serial number 130928 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) SD

Castle Ruins
This used to be your home. Now it is nothing more than a smoking pile of rubble. The smoke obscures your view of the stars, and the primary source of light is the burning remains of your furniture.

The only road away from the castle now ends abruptly at the river bank. The forest surrounds you thickly on all sides, except for an area to the north where the trees have been broken and scorched.

You open the vial, revealing an oily black liquid.

You drop the vial. It bounces harmlessly on the ground. The lid snaps shut in the process, and you don&apos;t lose more than a few drops of the oily black liquid.

This is the day you&apos;ve always dreamed of. You are finally marrying the love of your life, prince Roland.


Garden
You are standing in the garden behind your family&apos;s castle. On this lovely fall evening, it is doing double duty as a wedding chapel.

Your betrothed, Roland, stands before you.

You can also see Father Alfred here.

You slip the makeshift dress over your head and pull it down past your hips.

Burnt Forest
There&apos;s a trail of burned trees and what appear to be teeth leading to the northeast. One tree in particular catches your eye.

Castle Ruins
This used to be your home. Now it is nothing more than a smoking pile of rubble. The smoke obscures your view of the stars, and the primary source of light is the burning remains of your furniture.

The only road away from the castle now ends abruptly at the river bank. The forest surrounds you thickly on all sides, except for an area to the north where the trees have been broken and scorched.

You light the torch with the flames.

Castle Ruins
This used to be your home. Now it is nothing more than a smoking pile of rubble. The smoke obscures your view of the stars, and the primary source of light is the burning remains of your furniture.

The only road away from the castle now ends abruptly at the river bank. The forest surrounds you thickly on all sides, except for an area to the north where the trees have been broken and scorched.

    <result xml:space="preserve">You dig through the piles of rubble until you find a paper bag.

Taken.

You quickly fashion a dress out of the gift bag. It&apos;s not as fancy as you&apos;re used to, but it&apos;ll get the job done.

You strip off the remains of your wedding gown.

You slip the makeshift dress over your head and pull it down past your hips.

Burnt Forest
There&apos;s a trail of burned trees and what appear to be teeth leading to the northeast. One tree in particular catches your eye.

You beam happily at Roland.

Father Alfred begins the ceremony, &quot;We are gathered here today to witness the joining of two hearts.&quot; Roland smiles shyly at you.

&gt;[3] z
You beam happily at Roland.

&quot;If anyone has a reason why these two should not be wed, speak now or forever hold your peace.&quot; You hold your breath for a second, wondering whether anyone will speak up. Fortunately, nobody does and you relax.

&gt;[4] z
You beam happily at Roland.

&quot;Who gives this woman--&quot; You glare icily at the minister. You are nobody&apos;s property. &quot;Ahem. Moving on,&quot; says the minister, visibly flustered. Roland looks at you questioningly, but says nothing.

&gt;[5] z
You beam happily at Roland.

&quot;Love is a wonderful thing.&quot; And so on. You&apos;re too excited to pay attention to every word.

&gt;[6] z
You beam happily at Roland.

&quot;Elizabeth, do you take Roland to be your husband?&quot;

&gt;[7] yes
Of course you do!

The minister smiles at you and turns to Roland. &quot;And, Roland, do you take Elizabeth to be your wife?&quot;

Roland grins at you and exclaims, &quot;I do!&quot;

&quot;I now pronounce you man and... dragon?!?&quot; The minister&apos;s eyes go wide, seconds before he is incinerated by a burst of flame.

A large dragon flies overhead. The wedding guests scatter in every direction. You cower against Roland, but he pushes you towards the dragon and runs towards the road.

The dragon eats all the guests it can catch, and when it has had its fill, it smashes your castle to smithereens with its heavy tail and sets the remains on fire. You are nearly caught in a blaze of flame as you duck behind what used to be the stone wall of the garden. You are unhurt, but your fine gown snags on a rose bush and tears.

As the dragon finally turns to go, it catches sight of Roland, running down the road towards the river. It swoops down and smashes the bridge just as Roland is about to cross it and catches him up in its claws. The dragon flies away with your beloved prince.

The Paper Bag Princess
An interactive fairy tale by Adri
Release 1 / Serial number 131005 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) SD

Castle Ruins
This used to be your home. Now it is nothing more than a smoking pile of rubble. The smoke obscures your view of the stars, and the primary source of light is the burning remains of your furniture.

The only road away from the castle now ends abruptly at the river bank. The forest surrounds you thickly on all sides, except for an area to the north where the trees have been broken and scorched.

&gt;[9] search rubble
You dig through the piles of rubble until you find a paper bag.

You take the paper bag.

&gt;[11] make dress
You quickly fashion a dress out of the gift bag. It&apos;s not as fancy as you&apos;re used to, but it&apos;ll get the job done.

You strip off the remains of your wedding gown.

You slip the makeshift dress over your head and pull it down past your hips.

&gt;[12] n

POOF! Your fairy godmother appears. &quot;Tsk,&quot; she says. &quot;Poor girl. I&apos;m not sure I can help you with this one.&quot; She pauses and rummages around in her pockets, pulling out a vial. She hands it to you. &quot;This is the best I can do. Use it wisely.&quot; Then she vanishes, as quickly as she appeared.

Then it slams the door in your face.

You bang on the door again.

The dragon sticks its nose out the door and says, &quot;I am sure you are very delicious, but I am rather tired and stuffed. Please do come back tomorrow.&quot;

This time, however, he does not immediately return to his cave.

You grab the knocker and bang on the door.

The dragon sticks his nose out the door and says, &quot;Well, a princess! I love to eat princesses, but I have already eaten a whole castle today. I am a very busy dragon. Come back tomorrow.&quot; 

Then he slams the door.

The door opens and the dragon sticks his nose through the opening. He says, &quot;Well, a princess! I love to eat princesses, but I have already eaten a whole castle today. I am a very tired dragon. Come back tomorrow.&quot; 

Then he slams the door in your face.

You bang on the door again.

The dragon sticks his nose out the door and says, &quot;I am sure you are very delicious, but I am rather tired and stuffed. Please do come back tomorrow.&quot;

This time he pauses a moment before slamming the door.

&quot;Dragon!&quot; you exclaim. &quot;I have come to rescue my beloved prince.&quot;

Apparently it takes a lot to impress you! But you force yourself to look delighted as you shout, &quot;Do it again!&quot;

The dragon takes another huge breath and breathes out so much fire that he burns up one hundred forests.
Were you impressed by that display?

&quot;Wait!&quot; you exclaim.

Surprised, the dragon steps entirely out of the cave, nudging the door shut with its tail.

&quot;Is it true,&quot; you say, &quot;that you can burn up ten forests with your fiery breath?&quot;

&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; says the dragon, and it takes a huge, deep breath and breathes out so much fire that it burns up fifty forests.

This is the day you&apos;ve always dreamed of. You are finally marrying the love of your life, Prince Roland.


Castle Garden
You are standing in the garden behind your family&apos;s castle. On this lovely fall evening, it is doing double duty as a wedding chapel.

Your betrothed, Roland, stands before you.

You can also see Father Alfred here.

You beam happily at Roland.

&quot;If anyone has a reason why these two should not be wed, speak now or forever hold your peace.&quot; You hold your breath for a second, wondering whether anyone will speak up. Fortunately, nobody does and you relax.

&gt;[3] z
You beam happily at Roland.

&quot;Who gives this woman--&quot; You glare icily at the minister. You are nobody&apos;s property. &quot;Ahem. Moving on,&quot; says the minister, visibly flustered. Roland looks at you questioningly, but says nothing.

&gt;[4] z
You beam happily at Roland.

&quot;Love is a wonderful thing.&quot; And so on. You&apos;re too excited to pay attention to every word.

&gt;[5] z
You beam happily at Roland.

&quot;Elizabeth, do you take Roland to be your husband?&quot;

&gt;[6] z
The minister is waiting for your answer. Please say &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;.

&gt;[7] yes
Of course you do!

The minister smiles at you and turns to Roland. &quot;And, Roland, do you take Elizabeth to be your wife?&quot;

Roland grins at you and exclaims, &quot;I do!&quot;

&quot;I now pronounce you man and... dragon?!?&quot; The minister&apos;s eyes go wide, seconds before he is incinerated by a burst of flame.

A large dragon flies overhead. The wedding guests scatter in every direction. You cower against Roland, but he pushes you towards the dragon and runs towards the road.

The dragon eats all the guests it can catch, and when it has had its fill, it smashes your castle to smithereens with its heavy tail and sets the remains on fire. You are nearly caught in a blaze of flame as you duck behind what used to be the stone wall of the garden. You are unhurt, but your fine gown snags on a rose bush and tears.

As the dragon finally turns to go, it catches sight of Roland, running down the road towards the river. It swoops down and smashes the bridge just as Roland is about to cross it and catches him up in its claws. The dragon flies away with your beloved prince.

Castle Ruins
This used to be your home. Now it is nothing more than a smoking pile of rubble. The smoke obscures your view of the stars, and the primary source of light is the burning remains of your furniture.

The only road away from the castle now ends abruptly at the river bank. The forest surrounds you thickly on all sides, except for an area to the north where the trees have been broken and scorched.

&gt;[9] search rubble
You dig through the piles of rubble until you find a paper bag.

You quickly fashion a dress out of the gift bag. It&apos;s not as fancy as you&apos;re used to, but it&apos;ll get the job done.

You strip off the remains of your wedding gown.

You slip the makeshift dress over your head and pull it down past your hips.

Burnt Forest
There&apos;s a trail of burned trees and what appear to be teeth leading to the northeast. One tree in particular catches your eye.

The trail disappears into the woods.

You notice a large branch lying on the trail.

POOF! Your fairy godmother appears. &quot;Tsk,&quot; she says. &quot;Poor girl. I&apos;m not sure I can help you with this one.&quot; She pauses and rummages around in her pockets, pulling out a vial. She hands it to you. &quot;This is the best I can do. Use it wisely.&quot; Then she vanishes, as quickly as she appeared.

You are standing before a large cave. The entrance has been blocked by a large wooden door.

(Testing.)

&gt;[39] knock on door
You grab the knocker and bang on the door.

The door opens and the dragon sticks its nose through the opening. It says, &quot;Well, a princess! I love to eat princesses, but I have already eaten a whole castle today. I am a very tired dragon. Come back tomorrow.&quot; 

Then it slams the door in your face.

&gt;[40] g
You bang on the door again.

The dragon sticks its nose out the door and says, &quot;I am sure you are very delicious, but I am rather tired and stuffed. Please do come back tomorrow.&quot;

This time, however, he does not immediately return to his cave.

&quot;Wait!&quot; you exclaim.

Surprised, the dragon steps entirely out of the cave, nudging the door shut with its tail.

You say, &quot;Dragon, is it true that you can fly around the world in just ten seconds?&quot;

&quot;Why, yes,&quot; says the dragon, and it jumps up and flies around the world in just ten seconds. It seems very tired when it returns.

Were you impressed by that display? (Y/N)

Castle Ruins
This used to be your home. Now it is nothing more than a smoking pile of rubble. The smoke obscures your view of the stars, and the primary source of light is the burning remains of your furniture.

The only road away from the castle now ends abruptly at the river bank. The forest surrounds you thickly on all sides, except for an area to the north where the trees have been broken and scorched.

Then he slams the door in your face.

You bang on the door again.

The dragon sticks his nose out the door and says, &quot;I am sure you are very delicious, but I am rather tired and stuffed. Please do come back tomorrow.&quot;

This time he pauses a moment before slamming the door.

&quot;Dragon!&quot; you exclaim. &quot;I have come to rescue my beloved prince.&quot;

The dragon rolls his eyes and steps entirely out of the cave, nudging the door shut with his tail.

This used to be your home. Now it is nothing more than a smoking pile of rubble. The smoke obscures your view of the stars, and the primary source of light is the burning remains of your furniture.

The only road away from the castle now ends abruptly at the river bank. The forest surrounds you thickly on all sides, except for an area to the north where the trees have been broken and scorched.

You quickly fashion a dress out of the gift bag. It&apos;s not as fancy as you&apos;re used to, but it&apos;ll get the job done.

You strip off the remains of your wedding gown.

You slip the makeshift dress over your head and pull it down past your hips.

POOF! Your fairy godmother appears. &quot;Tsk,&quot; she says. &quot;Poor girl. I&apos;m not sure I can help you with this one.&quot; She pauses and rummages around in her pockets, pulling out a vial. She hands it to you. &quot;This is the best I can do. Use it wisely.&quot; Then she vanishes, as quickly as she appeared.

&gt;[18] test torch

&gt;[39] knock on door
You grab the knocker and bang on the door.

The door opens and the dragon sticks his nose through the opening. He says, &quot;Well, a princess! I love to eat princesses, but I have already eaten a whole castle today. I am a very tired dragon. Come back tomorrow.&quot; 

Then he slams the door in your face.

&gt;[40] g
You bang on the door again.

The dragon sticks his nose out the door and says, &quot;I am sure you are very delicious, but I am rather tired and stuffed. Please do come back tomorrow.&quot;

This time he pauses a moment before slamming the door.

&quot;If anyone has a reason why these two should not be wed, speak now or forever hold your peace.&quot; You hold your breath for a second, wondering whether anyone will speak up. Fortunately, nobody does and you relax.

You beam happily at Roland.

&quot;Who gives this woman--&quot; You glare icily at the minister. You are nobody&apos;s property. &quot;Ahem. Moving on,&quot; says the minister, visibly flustered. Roland looks at you questioningly, but says nothing.

You beam happily at Roland.

&quot;Love is a wonderful thing.&quot; And so on. You&apos;re too excited to pay attention to every word.

You beam happily at Roland.

&quot;Elizabeth, do you take Roland to be your husband?&quot;

The minister is waiting for your answer. Please say &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;.

Roland grins at you and exclaims, &quot;I do!&quot;.

&quot;I now pronounce you man and... dragon?!?&quot; The minister&apos;s eyes go wide, seconds before he is incinerated by a burst of flame.

A large dragon flies overhead. The wedding guests scatter in every direction. You cower against Roland, but he pushes you towards the dragon and runs towards the road.

The dragon eats all the guests it can catch, and when it has had its fill, it smashes your castle to smithereens with its heavy tail and sets the remains on fire. You are nearly caught in a blaze of flame as you duck behind what used to be the stone wall of the garden. You are unhurt, but your fine gown snags on a rose bush and tears.

As the dragon finally turns to go, it catches sight of Roland, running down the road towards the river. It swoops down and smashes the bridge just as Roland is about to cross it and catches him up in its claws. The dragon flies away with your beloved prince.

Roland grins at you and exclaims, &quot;I do!&quot;

&quot;I now pronounce you man and... dragon?!?&quot; The minister&apos;s eyes go wide, seconds before he is incinerated by a burst of flame.

A large dragon flies overhead. The wedding guests scatter in every direction. You cower against Roland, but he pushes you towards the dragon and runs towards the road.

The dragon eats all the guests it can catch, and when it has had its fill, it smashes your castle to smithereens with its heavy tail and sets the remains on fire. You are nearly caught in a blaze of flame as you duck behind what used to be the stone wall of the garden. You are unhurt, but your fine gown snags on a rose bush and tears.

As the dragon finally turns to go, it catches sight of Roland, running down the road towards the river. It swoops down and smashes the bridge just as Roland is about to cross it and catches him up in its claws. The dragon flies away with your beloved prince.

This is the day you&apos;ve always dreamed of. You are finally marrying the love of your life, Prince Roland.


Castle Garden
You are standing in the garden behind your family&apos;s castle. On this lovely fall evening, it is doing double duty as a wedding chapel.

Your betrothed, Roland, stands before you.

You can also see Father Alfred here.

Father Alfred begins the ceremony, &quot;We are gathered here today to witness the joining of two hearts.&quot; Roland smiles shyly at you.

&gt;[3] z
You beam happily at Roland.

&quot;If anyone has a reason why these two should not be wed, speak now or forever hold your peace.&quot; You hold your breath for a second, wondering whether anyone will speak up. Fortunately, nobody does and you relax.

&gt;[4] z
You beam happily at Roland.

&quot;Who gives this woman--&quot; You glare icily at the minister. You are nobody&apos;s property. &quot;Ahem. Moving on,&quot; says the minister, visibly flustered. Roland looks at you questioningly, but says nothing.

&gt;[5] z
You beam happily at Roland.

&quot;Love is a wonderful thing.&quot; And so on. You&apos;re too excited to pay attention to every word.

&gt;[6] z
You beam happily at Roland.

&quot;Elizabeth, do you take Roland to be your husband?&quot;

&gt;[7] yes
Of course you do!

The minister smiles at you and turns to Roland. &quot;And, Roland, do you take Elizabeth to be your wife?&quot;

Roland grins at you and exclaims, &quot;I do!&quot;

&quot;I now pronounce you man and... dragon?!?&quot; The minister&apos;s eyes go wide, seconds before he is incinerated by a burst of flame.

A large dragon flies overhead. The wedding guests scatter in every direction. You cower against Roland, but he pushes you towards the dragon and runs towards the road.

The dragon eats all the guests it can catch, and when it has had its fill, it smashes your castle to smithereens with its heavy tail and sets the remains on fire. You are nearly caught in a blaze of flame as you duck behind what used to be the stone wall of the garden. You are unhurt, but your fine gown snags on a rose bush and tears.

As the dragon finally turns to go, it catches sight of Roland, running down the road towards the river. It swoops down and smashes the bridge just as Roland is about to cross it and catches him up in its claws. The dragon flies away with your beloved prince.

This used to be your home. Now it is nothing more than a smoking pile of rubble. The smoke obscures your view of the stars, and the primary source of light is the burning remains of your furniture.

The only road away from the castle now ends abruptly at the river bank. The forest surrounds you thickly on all sides, except for an area to the north where the trees have been broken and scorched.

Then he slams the door in your face.

You beam happily at Roland.

&quot;If anyone has a reason why these two should not be wed, speak now or forever hold your peace.&quot; You hold your breath for a second, wondering whether anyone will speak up. Fortunately, nobody does and you relax.

You beam happily at Roland.

&quot;Who gives this woman--&quot; You glare icily at the minister. You are nobody&apos;s property. &quot;Ahem. Moving on,&quot; says the minister, visibly flustered. Roland looks at you questioningly, but says nothing.

You beam happily at Roland.

&quot;Love is a wonderful thing.&quot; And so on. You&apos;re too excited to pay attention to every word.

You beam happily at Roland.

&quot;Elizabeth, do you take Roland to be your husband?&quot;

Of course you do!

The minister smiles at you and turns to Roland. &quot;And, Roland, do you take Elizabeth to be your wife?&quot;

Roland grins at you and exclaims, &quot;I do!&quot;.

&quot;I now pronounce you man and... dragon?!?&quot; The minister&apos;s eyes go wide, seconds before he is incinerated by a burst of flame.

A large dragon flies overhead. The wedding guests scatter in every direction. You cower against Roland, but he pushes you towards the dragon and runs towards the road.

The dragon eats all the guests it can catch, and when it has had its fill, it smashes your castle to smithereens with its heavy tail and sets the remains on fire. You are nearly caught in a blaze of flame as you duck behind what used to be the stone wall of the garden. You are unhurt, but your fine gown snags on a rose bush and tears.

As the dragon finally turns to go, it catches sight of Roland, running down the road towards the river. It swoops down and smashes the bridge just as Roland is about to cross it and catches him up in its claws. The dragon flies away with your beloved prince.

The Paper Bag Princess
An interactive fairy tale by Adri
Release 1 / Serial number 130928 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) SD

Castle Ruins
This used to be your home. Now it is nothing more than a smoking pile of rubble. The smoke obscures your view of the stars, and the primary source of light is the burning remains of your furniture.

The only road away from the castle now ends abruptly at the river bank. The forest surrounds you thickly on all sides, except for an area to the north where the trees have been broken and scorched.

&gt;[9] search rubble
You dig through the piles of rubble until you find a paper bag.

&gt;[10] take bag
Taken.

&gt;[11] wear bag
You quickly fashion a dress out of the gift bag. It&apos;s not as fancy as you&apos;re used to, but it&apos;ll get the job done.

You strip off the remains of your wedding gown.

You slip the makeshift dress over your head and pull it down past your hips.

Burnt Forest
There&apos;s a trail of burned trees and what appear to be teeth leading to the northeast. One tree in particular catches your eye.

The trail disappears into the woods.

You find a large branch lying on the trail.

&gt;[17] plugh
POOF! Your fairy godmother appears. &quot;Tsk,&quot; she says. &quot;Poor girl. I&apos;m not sure I can help you with this one.&quot; She pauses and rummages around in her pockets, pulling out a vial. She hands it to you. &quot;This is the best I can do. Use it wisely.&quot; Then she vanishes, as quickly as she appeared.

The dragon eats all the guests it can catch, and when it has had its fill, it smashes your castle to smithereens with its heavy tail and sets the remains on fire.

The only road away from the castle now ends abruptly at the river bank. The forest surrounds you thickly on all sides, except for an area to the north where the trees have been broken and scorched.

This used to be your home. Now it is nothing more than a smoking pile of rubble. The smoke obscures your view of the stars, and the primary source of light is the burning remains of your furniture.

The only road away from the castle now ends abruptly at the river bank. The forest surrounds you thickly on all sides, except for an area to the north where the trees have been broken and scorched.

&gt;[7] test ruins
(Testing.)

&gt;[8] search rubble
You dig through the piles of rubble until you find a paper bag.

&gt;[9] take bag
You take the paper bag.

&gt;[10] make dress
You quickly fashion a dress out of the gift bag. It&apos;s not as fancy as you&apos;re used to, but it&apos;ll get the job done.

You strip off the remains of your wedding gown and discard them in a pile of rubble.

You slip the makeshift dress over your head and pull it down past your hips.

Burnt Forest
