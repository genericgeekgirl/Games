I was worried going into the forest that my light source would go out & I'd have liked a bit more indication of what would happen. E.g. your fairy godmother helped you, and maybe she should say 'It will last just long enough' or something.

That allows for narrative which I think the player would enjoy when stuck in the forest e.g. 'You have to be close to the dragon's cave.'

I got stuck finding what to ask the dragon about as well, but I could and should have figured it out. I'd have liked to see hints in response to this as well as an AMUSING section at the end--because I have a feeling this game put various touches I missed, and I want to see them.

Also, Rolande is still being stored as a subject as a "him" and not a "her"--that is, if you say ">x rolande >kiss her" the game doesn't know who "her" is supposed to be referring to, but ">x rolande >kiss him" works.

I do think that you could cue the "ask dragon about fire" and "ask dragon about flight" a little better, maybe in the response to "talk to dragon". I pretty much only figured those out because I know the story, and even then I had to poke at it a bit to get the right wording.

Found it curious that "put out fire" yields "you put out the flames", as that 1) doesn't actually happen and 2) if it did, at that point it would make the game unwinnable.

     You slap Rolande!

  "Rolande," you say, "your clothes are really pretty, and your hair is very
  neat. You look like a real princess, but you are also a real toad."

  You turn around and walk out the door.

I beg your pardon?

>light door
This dangerous act would achieve little.

>light door with torch
Whatever you expected to happen has not happened.

>put torch on door
(first taking the cave door)
That's hardly portable.

>attack door
Violence isn't the answer to this one.



"Yes," says the dragon. Boastful fellow, isn't he?

>yes
That was a rhetorical question.



>ask dragon about roland
The dragon says, "Oh, yes. I love to eat royals. But I have already eaten a whole castle today, so I am saving your prince for later."

"Where is he?" you cry.

"I cannot tell you that," says the dragon, although it casts a nervous look towards the cave.



>ask about castle
The dragon says, "That's very kind of you to offer, but I have already eaten a whole castle today."

"That was my home!" you shout.

The dragon shrugs. It doesn't seem particularly inclined to apologize.


[Adri says: what if the whole "eating people" thing isn't true, and is a cover for something else?"


>ask about home
The dragon says, "I'm afraid I don't know anything about that."



>ask about torch
The dragon laughs at you.



f>open door
The door is locked. Perhaps you should try knocking.

>; ah small goof
That's not a verb I recognize.


>kiss dragon
Keep your mind on the game.



>ask about door
The dragon says, "That is my home, and you are not welcome in there."

>ask about cave
The dragon says, "That is my home, and you are not welcome in there."

>ask about entrance
The dragon says, "That is my home, and you are not welcome in there."

>ask about wedding
The dragon says, "I'm afraid I don't know anything about that."

>ask about later
The dragon says, "I'm afraid I don't know anything about that."

>ask about eating
The dragon says, "I'm afraid I don't know anything about that."

>ask about eat
The dragon says, "I'm afraid I don't know anything about that."




>kiss roland
You're really not in the mood to do that.

>remove bag
You remove the gift bag, folding it carefully.

>give all to roland
You can't use multiple objects with that verb.

>give torch to roland
Roland glares at you.

>x torch
It is a torch crafted from a branch and the remains of your wedding gown.

>remove gown
You can't see any such thing.

>take gown
You can't see any such thing.

>get branch
You already have that.

>untie torch
That's not a verb I recognize.



>sleep
You aren't feeling especially drowsy.

You jump on the spot, fruitlessly.

Roland glares at you.

>x dragon
You can't see any such thing.
