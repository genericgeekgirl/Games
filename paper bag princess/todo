* testing:
- burn all the things
- talk to the dragon about all sorts of things

Getting the dragon to open the door the second time felt a bit clunky. The built-in "such and such doesn't fit the lock" is really misleading. "Examine lock... no such thing!"

Some cool stuff to chat about:
* Treasure -- might be fun to see the dragon really go in-depth here
* Trogdor / other popular (or subculture) dragons... are they related?
* How do humans taste? Recipes?
* What else is in the forest?
* Dragon's hobbies (pretty self-expanitory)
* Dragon games (perhaps not so much)
* Dungeons / Dragon hideaways
* Godzilla / kaiju stuff
