The > sign is where the game says, "Okay, what do you want to do now?"  You may respond by typing an instruction -- usually an imperative verb, possibly followed by prepositions and objects.  So, for instance, LOOK, LOOK AT FISH, TAKE FISH.

The first thing you want to do when starting a game is acquaint yourself with your surroundings and get a sense of your goal. To this end, you should read the introductory text carefully. Sometimes it contains clues. You will also want to look at the room you are in. Notice where the exits from the room are, and what objects are described here. If any of these seem interesting, you may want to EXAMINE them. 

You might also want to examine yourself (EXAMINE ME) to see whether the author has left you any clues about your character. TAKE INVENTORY will tell you what you're carrying, as well.

Once you've gotten your bearings, you may want to explore. Move from room to room, and check out every location available.

Most IF games are set in a world made up of rooms without internal division. Movement between rooms is possible; movement within a room does not always amount to anything. >WALK OVER TO THE DESK is rarely a useful sort of command. On the other hand, if something is described as being high or out of reach, it is sometimes relevant to stand on an object to increase your height. This kind of activity tends to be important only if prompted by the game text.

Other characters in IF games are sometimes rather limited. On the other hand, there are also games in which character interaction is the main point of the game. You should be able to get a feel early on for the characters -- if they seem to respond to a lot of questions, remember what they're told, move around on their own, etc., then they may be fairly important. If they have a lot of stock responses and don't seem to have been the game designer's main concern, then they are most likely present either as local color or to provide the solution to a specific puzzle or set of puzzles. Characters in very puzzle-oriented games often have to be bribed, threatened, or cajoled into doing something that the player cannot do -- giving up a piece of information or an object, reaching something high, allowing the player into a restricted area, and so on.

Castle Garden
You are standing in the garden behind your family's castle. On this lovely fall evening, it is doing double duty as a wedding chapel.

Your betrothed, Roland, stands before you.

You can also see Father Alfred here.

>examine
What do you want to examine?

>Roland
Roland is the most attractive man you have ever laid eyes on.

Father Alfred begins the ceremony, "We are gathered here today to witness the joining of two hearts." Roland smiles shyly at you.

>smile back
I only understood you as far as wanting to smile.

>smile at Roland
You smile warmly at Roland.

"If anyone has a reason why these two should not be wed, speak now or forever hold your peace." You hold your breath for a second, wondering whether anyone will speak up. Fortunately, nobody does and you relax.

>examine garden
Your grandmother planted these rose bushes. They bloom in every color you could imagine, plus some you don't even have names for.

"Who gives this woman--" You glare icily at the minister. You are nobody's property. "Ahem. Moving on," says the minister, visibly flustered. Roland looks at you questioningly, but says nothing.

>wait
You beam happily at Roland.

"Love is a wonderful thing." And so on. You're too excited to pay attention to every word.

>excited
That's not a verb I recognize.

>be excited
That's not a verb I recognize.

>listen
You hear nothing unexpected.

"Elizabeth, do you take Roland to be your husband?"

>say yes
Whom do you want to say that to?

>say i do to father alfred
The minister is waiting for your answer. Please say "yes" or "no".

>say yes to father alfred
Of course you do!

The minister smiles at you and turns to Roland. "And, Roland, do you take Elizabeth to be your wife?"

Roland grins at you and exclaims, "I do!"

"I now pronounce you man and... dragon?!?" The minister's eyes go wide, seconds before he is incinerated by a burst of flame.

A large dragon flies overhead. The wedding guests scatter in every direction. You cower against Roland, but he pushes you towards the dragon and runs towards the road.

The dragon eats all the guests it can catch, and when it has had its fill, it smashes your castle to smithereens with its heavy tail and sets the remains on fire. You are nearly caught in a blaze of flame as you duck behind what used to be the stone wall of the garden. You are unhurt, but your fine gown snags on a rose bush and tears.

As the dragon finally turns to go, it catches sight of Roland, running down the road towards the river. It swoops down and smashes the bridge just as Roland is about to cross it and catches him up in its claws. The dragon flies away with your beloved prince.

The Paper Bag Princess
An interactive fairy tale by Adri
Release 1 / Serial number 131021 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) 

Castle Ruins
This used to be your home. Now it is nothing more than a smoking pile of rubble. The smoke obscures your view of the stars, and the primary source of light is the burning remains of your furniture.

The only road away from the castle now ends abruptly at the river bank. The forest surrounds you thickly on all sides, except for an area to the north where the trees have been broken and scorched.

>get up
But you aren't in anything at the moment.

>stand up
But you aren't in anything at the moment.

>look around
You can't see any such thing.

The only road away from the castle now ends abruptly at the river bank. The forest surrounds you thickly on all sides, except for an area to the north where the trees have been broken and scorched.

>examine self
You are young and beautiful, too lovely to be described in mere words. You are, however, in dire need of a bath and a change of clothes.

You are wearing a handful of rags and a tarnished gold crown.

>walk to forest
You can't see any such thing.

>walk 
You'll have to say which compass direction to go in.

>walk north
Perhaps you should find something more substantial to wear first.

>search
What do you want to search?

>castle ruins
You dig through the piles of rubble until you find a paper bag.

>wear paper bag
You take the paper bag.

You quickly fashion a dress out of the gift bag. It's not as fancy as you're used to, but it'll get the job done.

You strip off the remains of your wedding gown.

You slip the makeshift dress over your head and pull it down past your hips.

>stand up
But you aren't in anything at the moment.

>walk north

Burnt Forest
There's a trail of burned trees and what appear to be teeth leading to the northeast. One tree in particular catches your eye.

>examine tree
You examine the tree more closely. Someone has carved "PLUGH" into the trunk.

There is a large branch propped up against the base of the tree.

>pick up branch
You take the branch.

>examine carving
You examine the tree more closely. Someone has carved "PLUGH" into the trunk.

>examine PLUGH
You can't see any such thing.

>examine teeth
Yes, those are definitely teeth. They come in a variety of shapes and sizes, most of which do not appear to be human. You wonder briefly where the rest of the bones are.

>look for other bones
You can't see any such thing.

>walk northeast
The woods seem pretty dark. Maybe you should find a light source.

>return to castle ruins
That's not a verb I recognize.

>go back to castle ruin
You can't see any such thing.

>go
You'll have to say which compass direction to go in.

>go south

Not quite, but you seem to be on the right track.

>light branch
Not quite, but you seem to be on the right track.

>set branch on fire
Not quite, but you seem to be on the right track.

>examine burning remains
These piles of stones and wood used to be your home.

>search burning
You find nothing of interest.

>pick up burning remains
That's hardly portable.

>pick up burning object
I only understood you as far as wanting to pick up the flames.

>pick up flames
This dangerous act would achieve little.

>put branch in flames
Not quite, but you seem to be on the right track.

I beg your pardon?

>I JUST WANT THE FLAMES
I only understood you as far as wanting to take inventory.

>get light source
I only understood you as far as wanting to get the flames.

>plugh
POOF! Your fairy godmother appears. "Tsk," she says. "Poor girl. I'm not sure I can help you with this one." She pauses and rummages around in her pockets, pulling out a vial. She hands it to you. "This is the best I can do. Use it wisely." Then she vanishes, as quickly as she appeared.

>examine vial
In the vial is an oily black liquid.

>x tree
You examine the tree more closely. Someone has carved "PLUGH" into the trunk.
