Princess Elizabeth is about to marry the love of her life when a dragon attacks the castle and kidnaps her betrothed.

The Paper Bag Princess is loosely based upon the book of the same name by Robert Munsch. Permission to write the game was requested from and granted by Mister Munsch himself.

The cover art of Elizabeth was graciously provided by Stacey, aka "iduck" on deviantART.

Thank you so much to my beta testers: Brendan Desilets, Dan Shiovitz, Dan Kelly, David Sturgis, Doug Orleans, Emily Boegheim, Jason McIntosh, Johnny Rivera, Kevin Jackson-Mead, Matthew Miller, Scott Snyder and Z Goddard. Post-release feedback from Adam Myers, Andrew Schultz, E Joyce, Felix Plesoianu and Victor Gijsbers was also particularly helpful to me.

Castle Garden
You are standing in the garden behind your family's castle. On this lovely fall evening, it is doing double duty as a wedding chapel.

Your betrothed, Roland, stands before you.

You can also see Father Alfred here.

>i
You are carrying a bouquet.

"If anyone has a reason why these two should not be wed, speak now or forever hold your peace." You hold your breath for a second, wondering whether anyone will speak up. Fortunately, nobody does and you relax.

>talk to roland
You lean in towards Roland and whisper in his ear. Roland smiles at you and holds a finger over his lips in an exaggerated "shush" motion.

"Who gives this woman--" You glare icily at the minister. You are nobody's property. "Ahem. Moving on," says the minister, visibly flustered. Roland looks at you questioningly, but says nothing.

>x roland
Roland is the most attractive man you have ever laid eyes on.

"Love is a wonderful thing." And so on. You're too excited to pay attention to every word.

>x alfred
Father Alfred has been your family's minister for as long as you can remember.

"Elizabeth, do you take Roland to be your husband?"

>yes
Of course you do!

The minister smiles at you and turns to Roland. "And, Roland, do you take Elizabeth to be your wife?"

Roland grins at you and exclaims, "I do!"

"I now pronounce you man and... dragon?!?" The minister's eyes go wide, seconds before he is incinerated by a burst of flame.

A large dragon flies overhead. The wedding guests scatter in every direction. You cower against Roland, but he pushes you towards the dragon and runs towards the road.

The dragon eats all the guests it can catch, and when it has had its fill, it smashes your castle to smithereens with its heavy tail and sets the remains on fire. You are nearly caught in a blaze of flame as you duck behind what used to be the stone wall of the garden. You are unhurt, but your fine gown snags on a rose bush and tears.

As the dragon finally turns to go, it catches sight of Roland, running down the road towards the river. It swoops down and smashes the bridge just as Roland is about to cross it and catches him up in its claws. The dragon flies away with your beloved prince.

The Paper Bag Princess
An interactive fairy tale by Adri
Release 1 / Serial number 131007 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) 

Castle Ruins
This used to be your home. Now it is nothing more than a smoking pile of rubble. The smoke obscures your view of the stars, and the primary source of light is the burning remains of your furniture.

The only road away from the castle now ends abruptly at the river bank. The forest surrounds you thickly on all sides, except for an area to the north where the trees have been broken and scorched.

>x me
You are young and beautiful, too lovely to be described in mere words. You are, however, in dire need of a bath and a change of clothes.

You are wearing a handful of rags and a tarnished gold crown.

>x rags
The tattered remains of your wedding gown.

>x crown
Your gold crown. It's looking a little worse for the wear.

You are carrying nothing.

The only possible path appears to be through the forest to the north.

You dig through the piles of rubble until you find a paper bag.

>take bag
You take the paper bag.

>x bag
It's a gift bag made out of paper. It looks like it used to have polka dots on it, but now it's just scorched.

>look in bag
You find nothing of interest.

>wear bag
You quickly fashion a dress out of the gift bag. It's not as fancy as you're used to, but it'll get the job done.

You strip off the remains of your wedding gown.

You slip the makeshift dress over your head and pull it down past your hips.

Burnt Forest
There's a trail of burned trees and what appear to be teeth leading to the northeast. One tree in particular catches your eye.

>x tree
You examine the tree more closely. Someone has carved "PLUGH" into the trunk.

There is a large branch propped up against the base of the tree.

>plugh
POOF! Your fairy godmother appears. "Tsk," she says. "Poor girl. I'm not sure I can help you with this one." She pauses and rummages around in her pockets, pulling out a vial. She hands it to you. "This is the best I can do. Use it wisely." Then she vanishes, as quickly as she appeared.

>xyzzy
You hear a faint sound in the distance. Help does not arrive.

The trees are impassable in that direction. The trail seems to be leading northeast.

It's a large branch. It looks pretty sturdy.

Outside the Dragon's Cave
You are standing before a large cave. The entrance has been blocked by a large wooden door.

>open door
The door is locked. Perhaps you should try knocking.

>knock on door
You grab the knocker and bang on the door.

The door opens and the dragon sticks its nose through the opening. It says, "Well, a princess! I love to eat princesses, but I have already eaten a whole castle today. I am a very tired dragon. Come back tomorrow." 

Then it slams the door in your face.

>knock on door
You bang on the door again.

The dragon sticks its nose out the door and says, "I am sure you are very delicious, but I am rather tired and stuffed. Please do come back tomorrow."

This time, however, he does not immediately return to his cave.

>x dragon
Up close, you realize this dragon isn't actually very large, only about fifteen cubits from the tip of its nose to the spiked end of its tail. Its wings are folded neatly at its sides, and a swirl of smoke escapes its nostrils.

>talk to dragon
"Wait!" you exclaim.

Surprised, the dragon steps entirely out of the cave, nudging the door shut with its tail.

You say, "Is it true that you are the fastest and fiercest dragon in the whole world?"

"Yes," says the dragon. Boastful fellow, isn't he?

>talk to dragon

The dragon is blocking the doorway and will not allow you to pass.

>move dragon
That would be less than courteous.

Outside the Dragon's Cave
You are standing before a large cave. The entrance has been blocked by a large wooden door.

You can see a dragon here.

>i
You are carrying a torch.

>x door
The large door almost perfectly fills in the natural opening in the rock. There is a golden knocker in the shape of a dragon's tail about a foot above your head.

>x smoke

>burn dragon
You have no way to do that.

>dragon, move

The dragon has better things to do.

>ask dragon about race
The dragon says, "I'm afraid I don't know anything about that."

>ask dragon about roland
The dragon says, "Oh, yes. I love to eat royals. But I have already eaten a whole castle today, so I am saving your prince for later."

"Where is he?" you cry.

"I cannot tell you that," says the dragon, although it casts a nervous look towards the cave.

>ask dragon about roland

"Where is he?" you cry.

>ask dragon about cave
The dragon says, "That is my home, and you are not welcome in there."

>ask dragon about prince
The dragon says, "Oh, yes. I love to eat royals. But I have already eaten a whole castle today, so I am saving your prince for later."

"Where is he?" you cry.

"I cannot tell you that," says the dragon, although it casts a nervous look towards the cave.

>ask dragon about castle
The dragon says, "That's very kind of you to offer, but I have already eaten a whole castle today."

"That was my home!" you shout.

The dragon shrugs. It doesn't seem particularly inclined to apologize.

>ask dragon about wedding
The dragon says, "I'm afraid I don't know anything about that."

>ne
The door leads into the cave. The only escape is back into the forest. You came to rescue Roland, and you are not leaving without him!

>take roland
You can't see any such thing.

>ask dragon about plugh
The dragon says, "I'm afraid I don't know anything about that."

>ask dragon about torch
The dragon laughs at you.

>ask dragon about fire
"Is it true," you say, "that you can burn up ten forests with your fiery breath?"

"Oh, yes," says the dragon, and it takes a huge, deep breath and breathes out so much fire that it burns up fifty forests.

Were you impressed by that display? (Y/N)

>Y
yes
"Fantastic!" you exclaim. "Do it again!"

The dragon takes another huge breath and breathes out so much fire that it burns up one hundred forests.

Wasn't that amazing?
