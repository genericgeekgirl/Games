Castle Ruins
This used to be your home. Now it is nothing more than a smoking pile of rubble. The smoke obscures your view of the stars, and the primary source of light is the burning remains of your furniture.

The only road away from the castle now ends abruptly at the river bank. The forest surrounds you thickly on all sides, except for an area to the north where the trees have been broken and scorched.

Examine every object and look at everything in your inventory. Open all the doors you can find, and go through them. Look inside all closed containers. Make sure you've exhausted all the options in your environment. 

Try out all your senses. If the game mentions texture, odor, or sound, try touching, smelling, listening to, or tasting objects.

Be thorough. If you still can't figure out what to do, try opening windows, looking under beds, etc. Sometimes objects are well-hidden.

Outside the Dragon's Cave
You are standing before a large cave. The entrance has been blocked by a large wooden door.

>save
Your game has been saved to the URL. You may want to bookmark this page now; just reload it at any time to restore your game from this point.
Ok.

>look door
The large door almost perfectly fills in the natural opening in the rock. There is a golden knocker in the shape of a dragon's tail about a foot above your head.

>go east
The door leads into the cave. The only escape is back into the forest. You came to rescue Roland, and you are not leaving without him!

>open door
The door is locked. Perhaps you should try knocking.

>pick lock
You can't see any such thing.

>sneak
That's not a verb I recognize.

>unlock door
What do you want to unlock the cave door with?

>my necklace
You can't see any such thing.

>because you refused to let me make one
That's not a verb I recognize.

>look self
You are young and beautiful, too lovely to be described in mere words. You are, however, in dire need of a bath and a change of clothes.

You are wearing a gift bag that has been fashioned into a rather respectable dress and a tarnished gold crown.

>take a bath
You can't see any such thing.

>take door
That's hardly portable.

>knock on door
You grab the knocker and bang on the door.

The door opens and the dragon sticks its nose through the opening. It says, "Well, a princess! I love to eat princesses, but I have already eaten a whole castle today. I am a very tired dragon. Come back tomorrow." 

Then it slams the door in your face.

>talk
What do you want to talk to?

>talk to dragon
You can't see any such thing.

>pray
That's not a verb I recognize.

>talk to fairy godmother
You can't see any such thing.

>talk to self
They say talking to oneself is a sign of genius. Or maybe that was madness. Is there really a difference?

>become mad
That's not a verb I recognize.

>become genius
That's not a verb I recognize.

>knock on door
You bang on the door again.

The dragon sticks its nose out the door and says, "I am sure you are very delicious, but I am rather tired and stuffed. Please do come back tomorrow."

This time, however, he does not immediately return to his cave.

>talk to dragon
"Wait!" you exclaim.

Surprised, the dragon steps entirely out of the cave, nudging the door shut with its tail.

You say, "Is it true that you are the fastest and fiercest dragon in the whole world?"

"Yes," says the dragon. Boastful fellow, isn't he?

>no
That was a rhetorical question.

>yes
That was a rhetorical question.

>enter cave
The dragon is blocking the doorway and will not allow you to pass.

>hug dragon
Keep your mind on the game.

>kiss dragon
Keep your mind on the game.

>give up
You can't see any such thing.

>give torch
(to the dragon)
The dragon sniffs at you and says dryly, "I am not interested in that."

>give crown
(to the dragon)
(first taking the tarnished gold crown off)
You should leave that on. A princess should never be without her crown.

>give bag
(to the dragon)
(first taking the gift bag that has been fashioned into a rather respectable dress off)
You remove the gift bag, folding it carefully.

The dragon sniffs at you and says dryly, "I am not interested in that."

>look self
You are young and beautiful, too lovely to be described in mere words. You are, however, in dire need of a bath and a change of clothes.

You are stark naked, save for a tarnished gold crown.

>pet dragon
Keep your mind on the game.

>cuddle dragon
That's not a verb I recognize.

>submit to dragon
That's not a verb I recognize.

>wear bag
You slip the makeshift dress over your head and pull it down past your hips.

>leave
But you aren't in anything at the moment.

>knock on door
You already have the dragon's attention.

>go south
The door leads into the cave. The only escape is back into the forest. You came to rescue Roland, and you are not leaving without him!

>talk to dragon
You say, "Is it true that you are the fastest and fiercest dragon in the whole world?"

"Yes," says the dragon. Boastful fellow, isn't he?

>yes
That was a rhetorical question.

>eat dragon
(first taking the dragon)
I don't suppose the dragon would care for that.

>lick dragon
That's not a verb I recognize.

>get eaten by dragon
You can't see any such thing.

>take dragon

Princess Elizabeth is about to marry the love of her life when a dragon attacks the castle and kidnaps her betrothed.

The Paper Bag Princess is loosely based upon the book of the same name by Robert Munsch. Permission to write the game was requested from and granted by Mister Munsch himself.

The cover art of Elizabeth was graciously provided by Stacey, aka "iduck" on deviantART.

Thank you so much to my beta testers: Brendan Desilets, Dan Shiovitz, Dan Kelly, David Sturgis, Doug Orleans, Emily Boegheim, Jason McIntosh, Johnny Rivera, Kevin Jackson-Mead, Matthew Miller, Scott Snyder and Z Goddard. Post-release feedback from Adam Myers, Andrew Schultz, E Joyce and Felix Plesoianu was also particularly helpful to me.

The > sign is where the game says, "Okay, what do you want to do now?"  You may respond by typing an instruction -- usually an imperative verb, possibly followed by prepositions and objects.  So, for instance, LOOK, LOOK AT FISH, TAKE FISH.

The first thing you want to do when starting a game is acquaint yourself with your surroundings and get a sense of your goal. To this end, you should read the introductory text carefully. Sometimes it contains clues. You will also want to look at the room you are in. Notice where the exits from the room are, and what objects are described here. If any of these seem interesting, you may want to EXAMINE them. 

You might also want to examine yourself (EXAMINE ME) to see whether the author has left you any clues about your character. TAKE INVENTORY will tell you what you're carrying, as well.

Once you've gotten your bearings, you may want to explore. Move from room to room, and check out every location available.

*** WARNING: Possible gap in the transcript ****** WARNING: Possible gap in the transcript ***At any given time, you are in a specific location, or room. When you go into a room, the game will print a description of what you can see there. This description will contain two vital kinds of information: things in the room you can interact with or take, and a list of exits, or ways out. If you want to see the description again, you may just type LOOK. 

When you want to leave a location and go to another one, you may communicate this to the game using compass directions: eg, GO NORTH. For simplicity's sake, you are allowed to omit the word GO, and to abbreviate the compass directions. So you may use NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST, NORTHEAST, SOUTHEAST, NORTHWEST, SOUTHWEST, UP, and DOWN, or in short form N, S, E, W, NE, SE, NW, SW, U, and D.

In some locations, IN and OUT will also be useful.

Throughout the game there will be assorted objects that you can do things with. Most importantly, you may TAKE or GET items, and (when you are tired of them) DROP them again. INVENTORY (abbreviated I) will list the items you are currently holding. 

There are usually assorted things you may do with these objects. OPEN, CLOSE, WEAR, EAT, LOCK, and UNLOCK are especially common.

Occasionally, you will find that the game does not recognize the name of an object even though it has been described as being in the room with you. If this is the case, the object is just there for scenery, and you may assume that you do not need to interact with it.

There are a few simple commands for controlling the game itself. These are: 

SAVE saves a snapshot of the game as it is now. 
RESTORE puts the game back to a previous saved state. You may keep as many saved games as you like. 
RESTART puts the game back to the way it was at the beginning. 
QUIT ends the game.

*** WARNING: Possible gap in the transcript ***Other characters in IF games are sometimes rather limited. On the other hand, there are also games in which character interaction is the main point of the game. You should be able to get a feel early on for the characters -- if they seem to respond to a lot of questions, remember what they're told, move around on their own, etc., then they may be fairly important. If they have a lot of stock responses and don't seem to have been the game designer's main concern, then they are most likely present either as local color or to provide the solution to a specific puzzle or set of puzzles. Characters in very puzzle-oriented games often have to be bribed, threatened, or cajoled into doing something that the player cannot do -- giving up a piece of information or an object, reaching something high, allowing the player into a restricted area, and so on.

Movement between rooms is possible; movement within a room does not always amount to anything. >WALK OVER TO THE DESK is rarely a useful sort of command. On the other hand, if something is described as being high or out of reach, it is sometimes relevant to stand on an object to increase your height. This kind of activity tends to be important only if prompted by the game text.
