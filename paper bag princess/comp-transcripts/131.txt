This is the day you've always dreamed of. You are finally marrying the love of your life, Prince Roland.


Castle Garden
You are standing in the garden behind your family's castle. On this lovely fall evening, it is doing double duty as a wedding chapel.

Your betrothed, Roland, stands before you.

You can also see Father Alfred here.

>die
That's not a verb I recognize.

>strangle self
That's not a verb I recognize.

>amusing
That's not a verb I recognize.

>die
That's not a verb I recognize.

>wait
You beam happily at Roland.

Father Alfred begins the ceremony, "We are gathered here today to witness the joining of two hearts." Roland smiles shyly at you.

>kill self
Violence isn't the answer to this one.

"If anyone has a reason why these two should not be wed, speak now or forever hold your peace." You hold your breath for a second, wondering whether anyone will speak up. Fortunately, nobody does and you relax.

>suicide
That's not a verb I recognize.

>wait
You beam happily at Roland.

"Who gives this woman--" You glare icily at the minister. You are nobody's property. "Ahem. Moving on," says the minister, visibly flustered. Roland looks at you questioningly, but says nothing.

>wait
You beam happily at Roland.

"Love is a wonderful thing." And so on. You're too excited to pay attention to every word.

>wait
You beam happily at Roland.

"Elizabeth, do you take Roland to be your husband?"

>yes
Of course you do!

The minister smiles at you and turns to Roland. "And, Roland, do you take Elizabeth to be your wife?"

Roland grins at you and exclaims, "I do!"

"I now pronounce you man and... dragon?!?" The minister's eyes go wide, seconds before he is incinerated by a burst of flame.

A large dragon flies overhead. The wedding guests scatter in every direction. You cower against Roland, but he pushes you towards the dragon and runs towards the road.

The dragon eats all the guests it can catch, and when it has had its fill, it smashes your castle to smithereens with its heavy tail and sets the remains on fire. You are nearly caught in a blaze of flame as you duck behind what used to be the stone wall of the garden. You are unhurt, but your fine gown snags on a rose bush and tears.

As the dragon finally turns to go, it catches sight of Roland, running down the road towards the river. It swoops down and smashes the bridge just as Roland is about to cross it and catches him up in its claws. The dragon flies away with your beloved prince.

The Paper Bag Princess
An interactive fairy tale by Adri
Release 1 / Serial number 131021 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) 

Castle Ruins
This used to be your home. Now it is nothing more than a smoking pile of rubble. The smoke obscures your view of the stars, and the primary source of light is the burning remains of your furniture.

The only road away from the castle now ends abruptly at the river bank. The forest surrounds you thickly on all sides, except for an area to the north where the trees have been broken and scorched.

>get in fire
They're not something you can enter.

>light self on fire
I only understood you as far as wanting to light yourself.

>burn self
This dangerous act would achieve little.

>search rubble
You dig through the piles of rubble until you find a paper bag.

>search flames
You find nothing of interest.

>burn bag
This dangerous act would achieve little.

>burn self
This dangerous act would achieve little.

>get in fire
They're not something you can enter.

>x flames
The flames burn brightly.

>touch flames
This dangerous act would achieve little.

>touch river
You feel nothing unexpected.

>g
You feel nothing unexpected.

>get in river

>drown

>wear bag
You take the paper bag.

You quickly fashion a dress out of the gift bag. It's not as fancy as you're used to, but it'll get the job done.

You strip off the remains of your wedding gown.

You slip the makeshift dress over your head and pull it down past your hips.

>this game sucks

Burnt Forest
There's a trail of burned trees and what appear to be teeth leading to the northeast. One tree in particular catches your eye.

>say plugh
POOF! Your fairy godmother appears. "Tsk," she says. "Poor girl. I'm not sure I can help you with this one." She pauses and rummages around in her pockets, pulling out a vial. She hands it to you. "This is the best I can do. Use it wisely." Then she vanishes, as quickly as she appeared.

>drink vial
The vial isn't open.

>open vial
You open the vial.

>drink vial
As you bring vial towards your mouth, you catch a whiff of the liquid inside and gag. Drinking that seems like a bad idea.

>pour vial on bag
There isn't very much in the bottle. You shouldn't waste it.

>take branch
You can't see any such thing.

>x tree
You examine the tree more closely. Someone has carved "PLUGH" into the trunk.

There is a large branch propped up against the base of the tree.

>take branch
You take the branch.

>hit self with branch
Violence isn't the answer to this one.

You fashion a torch from the branch and the remains of your wedding gown.

Ew. You really don't want that all over your skin.

>drink vial
As you bring vial towards your mouth, you catch a whiff of the liquid inside and gag. Drinking that seems like a bad idea.

You pour the oily black liquid onto the torch and discard the empty vial.

As you emerge from the forest, the torch suddenly fizzles out.

Outside the Dragon's Cave
You are standing before a large cave. The entrance has been blocked by a large wooden door.

>s
The door leads into the cave. The only escape is back into the forest. You came to rescue Roland, and you are not leaving without him!

>look
Outside the Dragon's Cave
You are standing before a large cave. The entrance has been blocked by a large wooden door.

>x cave
The large door almost perfectly fills in the natural opening in the rock. There is a golden knocker in the shape of a dragon's tail about a foot above your head.

>burn door
This dangerous act would achieve little.

>knock
(the cave door)
You grab the knocker and bang on the door.

The door opens and the dragon sticks its nose through the opening. It says, "Well, a princess! I love to eat princesses, but I have already eaten a whole castle today. I am a very tired dragon. Come back tomorrow." 

Then it slams the door in your face.

>knock
(the cave door)
You bang on the door again.

The dragon sticks its nose out the door and says, "I am sure you are very delicious, but I am rather tired and stuffed. Please do come back tomorrow."

This time, however, he does not immediately return to his cave.

>ask about princess
(addressing the dragon)
"Wait!" you exclaim.

Surprised, the dragon steps entirely out of the cave, nudging the door shut with its tail.

The dragon says, "I'm afraid I don't know anything about that."

>ask about lesbians
The dragon says, "I'm afraid I don't know anything about that."

>ask about prince
The dragon says, "Oh, yes. I love to eat royals. But I have already eaten a whole castle today, so I am saving your prince for later."

"Where is he?" you cry.

"I cannot tell you that," says the dragon, although it casts a nervous look towards the cave.

>g

>ask about death

The dragon is much larger and stronger than you. Perhaps you can outwit it in some way.

>sing
You sing a few bars of a lullaby your mother used to sing to you.

The dragon seems to relax at the sound.

>sing
You sing a few bars of a lullaby your mother used to sing to you.

It seems to be having the desired effect on the dragon.

>sing

It seems to be having the desired effect on the dragon.

The dragon is so tired that he falls fast asleep.

>sing
You sing a few bars of a lullaby your mother used to sing to you.

>shout
You whisper very softly, "Hey, dragon."

The dragon doesn't stir.

>shout
You lift the dragon's ear and put your head right inside. You shout as loudly as you can, "Hey, dragon!"

The dragon doesn't react.

>hit dragon
The dragon is harmless to you while asleep.

>shout
The dragon seems to be fast asleep. You could probably sneak right past it now.

You can't see any such thing.

>in
(first opening the cave door)
You step over the dragon and open the door to the cave.

The Dragon's Cave
This is where the dragon lives. Piles of treasure fill the room, reflecting light in every direction.

Your betrothed, Roland, stands before you.

Roland looks at you and says, "Elizabeth, you are a mess! You smell like ashes, your hair is all tangled, and you are wearing a dirty paper bag. Come back when you are dressed like a real princess."

>hit roland with stick
You can't see any such thing.

>kill roland
You slap Roland!

"Roland," you say, "your clothes are really pretty, and your hair is very neat. You look like a real prince, but you are also a real toad."

You turn around and walk out the door.



    *** And Elizabeth lived happily ever after! ***

Have you tried...
