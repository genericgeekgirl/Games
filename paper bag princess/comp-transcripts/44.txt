This is the day you've always dreamed of. You are finally marrying the love of your life, Prince Roland.


Castle Garden
You are standing in the garden behind your family's castle. On this lovely fall evening, it is doing double duty as a wedding chapel.

Your betrothed, Roland, stands before you.

You can also see Father Alfred here.

>i
You are carrying a bouquet.

Father Alfred begins the ceremony, "We are gathered here today to witness the joining of two hearts." Roland smiles shyly at you.

>x alfred
Father Alfred has been your family's minister for as long as you can remember.

"If anyone has a reason why these two should not be wed, speak now or forever hold your peace." You hold your breath for a second, wondering whether anyone will speak up. Fortunately, nobody does and you relax.

>x roland
Roland is the most attractive man you have ever laid eyes on.

"Who gives this woman--" You glare icily at the minister. You are nobody's property. "Ahem. Moving on," says the minister, visibly flustered. Roland looks at you questioningly, but says nothing.

"Love is a wonderful thing." And so on. You're too excited to pay attention to every word.

>x bouquet
Your bouquet contains a collection of purple and orange flowers, tied up with a white ribbon. You don't even know what most of those flowers are called.

"Elizabeth, do you take Roland to be your husband?"

>yes
Of course you do!

The minister smiles at you and turns to Roland. "And, Roland, do you take Elizabeth to be your wife?"

Roland grins at you and exclaims, "I do!"

"I now pronounce you man and... dragon?!?" The minister's eyes go wide, seconds before he is incinerated by a burst of flame.

A large dragon flies overhead. The wedding guests scatter in every direction. You cower against Roland, but he pushes you towards the dragon and runs towards the road.

The dragon eats all the guests it can catch, and when it has had its fill, it smashes your castle to smithereens with its heavy tail and sets the remains on fire. You are nearly caught in a blaze of flame as you duck behind what used to be the stone wall of the garden. You are unhurt, but your fine gown snags on a rose bush and tears.

As the dragon finally turns to go, it catches sight of Roland, running down the road towards the river. It swoops down and smashes the bridge just as Roland is about to cross it and catches him up in its claws. The dragon flies away with your beloved prince.

Castle Ruins
This used to be your home. Now it is nothing more than a smoking pile of rubble. The smoke obscures your view of the stars, and the primary source of light is the burning remains of your furniture.

The only road away from the castle now ends abruptly at the river bank. The forest surrounds you thickly on all sides, except for an area to the north where the trees have been broken and scorched.

>n
Perhaps you should find something more substantial to wear first.

>x rubble
These piles of stones and wood used to be your home. You catch a glimpse of something colorful hidden in one of the piles.

>x furniture
You think you can make out the leg of a chair somewhere in that mess. It's mostly just a blaze of fire.

>x piles
These piles of stones and wood used to be your home. You catch a glimpse of something colorful hidden in one of the piles.

>x colorful
You can't quite make it out from here. Why don't you try digging through the rubble?

>dig
(the rubble)
You dig through the piles of rubble until you find a paper bag.

>get paper bag
You take the paper bag.

>x it
It's a gift bag made out of paper. It looks like it used to have polka dots on it, but now it's just scorched.

>wear it
You quickly fashion a dress out of the gift bag. It's not as fancy as you're used to, but it'll get the job done.

You strip off the remains of your wedding gown.

You slip the makeshift dress over your head and pull it down past your hips.

>dig
(the rubble)
You don't find anything else.

Burnt Forest
There's a trail of burned trees and what appear to be teeth leading to the northeast. One tree in particular catches your eye.

>x tree
You examine the tree more closely. Someone has carved "PLUGH" into the trunk.

There is a large branch propped up against the base of the tree.

>plugh
POOF! Your fairy godmother appears. "Tsk," she says. "Poor girl. I'm not sure I can help you with this one." She pauses and rummages around in her pockets, pulling out a vial. She hands it to you. "This is the best I can do. Use it wisely." Then she vanishes, as quickly as she appeared.

>get branch
You take the branch.

>xyzzy
You hear a faint sound in the distance. Help does not arrive.

>i
You are carrying a branch, a vial (closed), and a handful of rags.

>x branch
It's a large branch. It looks pretty sturdy.

>x vial
In the vial is an oily black liquid.

>x rags
The tattered remains of your wedding gown.

>ne
The woods seem pretty dark. Maybe you should find a light source.

>put rags on branch
You fashion a torch from the branch and the remains of your wedding gown.

>pput oil on branch
That's not a verb I recognize.

>put oil on torch
The vial isn't open.

>open vial
You open the vial.

>put oil on torch
You pour the oily black liquid onto the torch and discard the empty vial.

>light torch
There is no source of fire here.

Outside the Dragon's Cave
You are standing before a large cave. The entrance has been blocked by a large wooden door.

>open door
The door is locked. Perhaps you should try knocking.

>knock
(the cave door)
You grab the knocker and bang on the door.

The door opens and the dragon sticks its nose through the opening. It says, "Well, a princess! I love to eat princesses, but I have already eaten a whole castle today. I am a very tired dragon. Come back tomorrow." 

Then it slams the door in your face.

>plugh
You hear a faint sound in the distance. Help does not arrive.

>knock
(the cave door)
You bang on the door again.

The dragon sticks its nose out the door and says, "I am sure you are very delicious, but I am rather tired and stuffed. Please do come back tomorrow."

This time, however, he does not immediately return to his cave.

>talk to dragon
"Wait!" you exclaim.

Surprised, the dragon steps entirely out of the cave, nudging the door shut with its tail.

You say, "Is it true that you are the fastest and fiercest dragon in the whole world?"

"Yes," says the dragon. Boastful fellow, isn't he?

>g
You say, "Is it true that you are the fastest and fiercest dragon in the whole world?"

"Yes," says the dragon. Boastful fellow, isn't he?

>x dragon
Up close, you realize this dragon isn't actually very large, only about fifteen cubits from the tip of its nose to the spiked end of its tail. Its wings are folded neatly at its sides, and a swirl of smoke escapes its nostrils.

>touch dragon
Keep your hands to yourself!

>i
You are carrying a torch.

>hit dragon
The dragon is much larger and stronger than you. Perhaps you can outwit it in some way.

>ask dragon about roland
The dragon says, "Oh, yes. I love to eat royals. But I have already eaten a whole castle today, so I am saving your prince for later."

"Where is he?" you cry.

"I cannot tell you that," says the dragon, although it casts a nervous look towards the cave.

>look
Outside the Dragon's Cave
You are standing before a large cave. The entrance has been blocked by a large wooden door.

You can see a dragon here.

>ask dragon about me
The dragon says, "I do love to eat princesses, but I have already eaten a whole castle today. Please come back tomorrow."

>challenge dragon
Dragons are well known for breathing FIRE and their ability to FLY. Maybe you could try asking about one of those.

>ask dragon about flying
You say, "Dragon, is it true that you can fly around the world in just ten seconds?"

"Why, yes," says the dragon, and it jumps up and flies around the world in just ten seconds. It seems very tired when it returns.

Wasn't that amazing? (Y/N)

>Y
yes
"Fantastic!" you exclaim. "Do it again!"

The dragon jumps up and flies around the whole world in just twenty seconds. When it returns, it flops down on the ground.

>ask dragon about flying
The dragon is too tired to stand up.

>n
The door leads into the cave. The only escape is back into the forest. You came to rescue Roland, and you are not leaving without him!

>enter cave
The dragon is blocking the doorway and will not allow you to pass.

>ask dragon about fire
"Is it true," you say, "that you can burn up ten forests with your fiery breath?"

"Oh, yes," says the dragon, and it takes a huge, deep breath and breathes out so much fire that it burns up fifty forests.

Were you impressed by that display? 

>N
no
Apparently it takes a lot to impress you! But you force yourself to look delighted as you shout, "Do it again!"

The dragon takes another huge breath and breathes out so much fire that it burns up one hundred forests.

Wasn't that amazing? 

>N
no
Apparently it takes a lot to impress you! But you force yourself to look delighted as you shout, "Do it again!"

The dragon takes another huge breath. But this time, nothing comes out.

The dragon is so tired that he falls fast asleep.

>enter
You must supply a noun.

>enter door
(first opening the cave door)

The Dragon's Cave
This is where the dragon lives. Piles of treasure fill the room, reflecting light in every direction.

Your betrothed, Roland, stands before you.

Roland looks at you and says, "Elizabeth, you are a mess! You smell like ashes, your hair is all tangled, and you are wearing a dirty paper bag. Come back when you are dressed like a real princess."

>hit roland
You slap Roland!

"Roland," you say, "your clothes are really pretty, and your hair is very neat. You look like a real prince, but you are also a real toad."

You turn around and walk out the door.



    *** And Elizabeth lived happily ever after! ***
