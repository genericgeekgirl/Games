This is the day you've always dreamed of. You are finally marrying the love of your life, Prince Roland.


Castle Garden
You are standing in the garden behind your family's castle. On this lovely fall evening, it is doing double duty as a wedding chapel.

Your betrothed, Roland, stands before you.

You can also see Father Alfred here.

>speak to father alfred
I only understood you as far as wanting to speak.

>speak
Shout! Shout! Let it all out!

Father Alfred begins the ceremony, "We are gathered here today to witness the joining of two hearts." Roland smiles shyly at you.

>smile
You smile happily.

"If anyone has a reason why these two should not be wed, speak now or forever hold your peace." You hold your breath for a second, wondering whether anyone will speak up. Fortunately, nobody does and you relax.

>sigh
That's not a verb I recognize.

>cry
You're suddenly overcome with emotion. You dab at your eyes with the end of the ribbon on your bouquet.

"Who gives this woman--" You glare icily at the minister. You are nobody's property. "Ahem. Moving on," says the minister, visibly flustered. Roland looks at you questioningly, but says nothing.

>cry
You're suddenly overcome with emotion. You dab at your eyes with the end of the ribbon on your bouquet.

"Love is a wonderful thing." And so on. You're too excited to pay attention to every word.

>look around
You can't see any such thing.

>look
Castle Garden
You are standing in the garden behind your family's castle. On this lovely fall evening, it is doing double duty as a wedding chapel.

Your betrothed, Roland, stands before you.

You can also see Father Alfred here.

"Elizabeth, do you take Roland to be your husband?"

>maybe
That's not a verb I recognize.

>say maybe
Whom do you want to say that to?

>father alfred
The minister is waiting for your answer. Please say "yes" or "no".

>yes
Of course you do!

The minister smiles at you and turns to Roland. "And, Roland, do you take Elizabeth to be your wife?"

Roland grins at you and exclaims, "I do!"

"I now pronounce you man and... dragon?!?" The minister's eyes go wide, seconds before he is incinerated by a burst of flame.

A large dragon flies overhead. The wedding guests scatter in every direction. You cower against Roland, but he pushes you towards the dragon and runs towards the road.

The dragon eats all the guests it can catch, and when it has had its fill, it smashes your castle to smithereens with its heavy tail and sets the remains on fire. You are nearly caught in a blaze of flame as you duck behind what used to be the stone wall of the garden. You are unhurt, but your fine gown snags on a rose bush and tears.

As the dragon finally turns to go, it catches sight of Roland, running down the road towards the river. It swoops down and smashes the bridge just as Roland is about to cross it and catches him up in its claws. The dragon flies away with your beloved prince.

The Paper Bag Princess
An interactive fairy tale by Adri
Release 1 / Serial number 131007 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) 

Castle Ruins
This used to be your home. Now it is nothing more than a smoking pile of rubble. The smoke obscures your view of the stars, and the primary source of light is the burning remains of your furniture.

The only road away from the castle now ends abruptly at the river bank. The forest surrounds you thickly on all sides, except for an area to the north where the trees have been broken and scorched.

>search for food
You can't see any such thing.

>search
What do you want to search?

>the castle ruins
You dig through the piles of rubble until you find a paper bag.

>examine paper bag
It's a gift bag made out of paper. It looks like it used to have polka dots on it, but now it's just scorched.

>take paper bag
You take the paper bag.

>go to river
You can't see any such thing.

>examine river
The water is very deep here, and it moves quickly. Your father used to scare you with stories of sharks, although you have never actually seen one.

>drink water
There's nothing suitable to drink here.

>drink river
There's nothing suitable to drink here.

>go north
Perhaps you should find something more substantial to wear first.

>go east
The only possible path appears to be through the forest to the north.

>wear paper bag
You quickly fashion a dress out of the gift bag. It's not as fancy as you're used to, but it'll get the job done.

You strip off the remains of your wedding gown.

You slip the makeshift dress over your head and pull it down past your hips.

>go north

Burnt Forest
There's a trail of burned trees and what appear to be teeth leading to the northeast. One tree in particular catches your eye.

>look at tree
You examine the tree more closely. Someone has carved "PLUGH" into the trunk.

There is a large branch propped up against the base of the tree.

>take branch
You take the branch.

>examine branch
It's a large branch. It looks pretty sturdy.

>go northeast
The woods seem pretty dark. Maybe you should find a light source.

>plug in tree branch
That's not a verb I recognize.

>plugh
POOF! Your fairy godmother appears. "Tsk," she says. "Poor girl. I'm not sure I can help you with this one." She pauses and rummages around in her pockets, pulling out a vial. She hands it to you. "This is the best I can do. Use it wisely." Then she vanishes, as quickly as she appeared.

>take vial
You already have that.

>examine vial
In the vial is an oily black liquid.

>drink vial
The vial isn't open.

>open vial
You open the vial.

>drink vial
As you bring vial towards your mouth, you catch a whiff of the liquid inside and gag. Drinking that seems like a bad idea.

>pour vial over branch
You can't see any such thing.

>pour vial
What do you want to pour the vial on?

>branch
Not quite, but you seem to be on the right track.

>pour vial
What do you want to pour the vial on?

>on me
You can't see any such thing.

>pour vial
What do you want to pour the vial on?

>me
Ew. You really don't want that all over your skin.

>pour vial
What do you want to pour the vial on?

>ground
You can't see any such thing.

>pour vial
What do you want to pour the vial on?

>dress
There isn't very much in the bottle. You shouldn't waste it.
