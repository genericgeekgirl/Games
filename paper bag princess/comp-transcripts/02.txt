This is the day you've always dreamed of. You are finally marrying the love of your life, Prince Roland.


Castle Garden
You are standing in the garden behind your family's castle. On this lovely fall evening, it is doing double duty as a wedding chapel.

Your betrothed, Roland, stands before you.

You can also see Father Alfred here.

>i
You are carrying a bouquet.

Father Alfred begins the ceremony, "We are gathered here today to witness the joining of two hearts." Roland smiles shyly at you.

>kiss roland
You'll have your chance soon enough!

"If anyone has a reason why these two should not be wed, speak now or forever hold your peace." You hold your breath for a second, wondering whether anyone will speak up. Fortunately, nobody does and you relax.

>z
You beam happily at Roland.

"Who gives this woman--" You glare icily at the minister. You are nobody's property. "Ahem. Moving on," says the minister, visibly flustered. Roland looks at you questioningly, but says nothing.

>z
You beam happily at Roland.

"Love is a wonderful thing." And so on. You're too excited to pay attention to every word.

>z
You beam happily at Roland.

"Elizabeth, do you take Roland to be your husband?"

>yes
Of course you do!

The minister smiles at you and turns to Roland. "And, Roland, do you take Elizabeth to be your wife?"

Roland grins at you and exclaims, "I do!"

"I now pronounce you man and... dragon?!?" The minister's eyes go wide, seconds before he is incinerated by a burst of flame.

A large dragon flies overhead. The wedding guests scatter in every direction. You cower against Roland, but he pushes you towards the dragon and runs towards the road.

The dragon eats all the guests it can catch, and when it has had its fill, it smashes your castle to smithereens with its heavy tail and sets the remains on fire. You are nearly caught in a blaze of flame as you duck behind what used to be the stone wall of the garden. You are unhurt, but your fine gown snags on a rose bush and tears.

As the dragon finally turns to go, it catches sight of Roland, running down the road towards the river. It swoops down and smashes the bridge just as Roland is about to cross it and catches him up in its claws. The dragon flies away with your beloved prince.

Castle Ruins
This used to be your home. Now it is nothing more than a smoking pile of rubble. The smoke obscures your view of the stars, and the primary source of light is the burning remains of your furniture.

The only road away from the castle now ends abruptly at the river bank. The forest surrounds you thickly on all sides, except for an area to the north where the trees have been broken and scorched.

>x me
You are young and beautiful, too lovely to be described in mere words. You are, however, in dire need of a bath and a change of clothes.

You are wearing a handful of rags and a tarnished gold crown.

>x crown
Your gold crown. It's looking a little worse for the wear.

>shit
Real princesses do not use such language.

>x rags
The tattered remains of your wedding gown.

>n
Perhaps you should find something to wear first.

You can't see any such thing.

>x rubble
These piles of stones and wood used to be your home. You catch a glimpse of something colorful hidden in one of the piles.

>x colorful
You can't quite make it out from here. Why don't you try digging through the rubble?

>dig

You dig through the piles of rubble until you find a paper bag.

>get bag
You take the paper bag.

>wear ti
You can't see any such thing.

>wear bag
You quickly fashion a dress out of the gift bag. It's not as fancy as you're used to, but it'll get the job done.

You strip off the remains of your wedding gown.

You slip the makeshift dress over your head and pull it down past your hips.

Burnt Forest
There's a trail of burned trees and what appear to be teeth leading to the northeast. One tree in particular catches your eye.

>x tree
You examine the tree more closely. Someone has carved "PLUGH" into the trunk.

There is a large branch propped up against the base of the tree.

>plugh
POOF! Your fairy godmother appears. "Tsk," she says. "Poor girl. I'm not sure I can help you with this one." She pauses and rummages around in her pockets, pulling out a vial. She hands it to you. "This is the best I can do. Use it wisely." Then she vanishes, as quickly as she appeared.

Outside the Dragon's Cave
You are standing before a large cave. The entrance has been blocked by a large wooden door.

>x door
The large door almost perfectly fills in the natural opening in the rock. There is a golden knocker in the shape of a dragon's tail about a foot above your head.

>open door
The door is locked. Perhaps you should try knocking.

>knock
(the cave door)
You grab the knocker and bang on the door.

The door opens and the dragon sticks its nose through the opening. It says, "Well, a princess! I love to eat princesses, but I have already eaten a whole castle today. I am a very tired dragon. Come back tomorrow." 

Then it slams the door in your face.

>knock
(the cave door)
You bang on the door again.

The dragon sticks its nose out the door and says, "I am sure you are very delicious, but I am rather tired and stuffed. Please do come back tomorrow."

This time, however, he does not immediately return to his cave.

>talk to dragon
"Wait!" you exclaim.

Surprised, the dragon steps entirely out of the cave, nudging the door shut with its tail.

You say, "Is it true that you are the smartest and fiercest dragon in the whole world?"

"Yes," says the dragon. Boastful fellow, isn't he?

>talk to dragon
You say, "Is it true that you are the smartest and fiercest dragon in the whole world?"

"Yes," says the dragon. Boastful fellow, isn't he?

>attack dragon
The dragon is much larger and stronger than you. Perhaps you can outwit it in some way.

>outwit dragon
Maybe you could try asking the dragon about fire or flight.

>ask dragon about fire
"Is it true," you say, "that you can burn up ten forests with your fiery breath?"

"Oh, yes," says the dragon, and it takes a huge, deep breath and breathes out so much fire that it burns up fifty forests.

Were you impressed by that display?

>N
no
Apparently it takes a lot to impress you! But you force yourself to look delighted as you shout, "Do it again!"

The dragon takes another huge breath and breathes out so much fire that it burns up one hundred forests.

Wasn't that amazing?

>N
no
Apparently it takes a lot to impress you! But you force yourself to look delighted as you shout, "Do it again!"

The dragon takes another huge breath. But this time, nothing comes out.

>ask dragon about flight
You say, "Dragon, is it true that you can fly around the world in just ten seconds?"

"Why, yes," says the dragon, and it jumps up and flies around the world in just ten seconds. It seems very tired when it returns.

Were you impressed by that display?

>N
no
Apparently it takes a lot to impress you! But you force yourself to look delighted as you shout, "Do it again!"

The dragon jumps up and flies around the whole world in just twenty seconds. When it returns, it flops down on the ground.

The dragon is so tired that he falls fast asleep.

>open door
You open the cave door.

>in

The Dragon's Cave
This is where the dragon lives. Piles of treasure fill the room, reflecting light in every direction.

Your betrothed, Roland, stands before you.

Roland looks at you and says, "Elizabeth, you are a mess! You smell like ashes, your hair is all tangled, and you are wearing a dirty paper bag. Come back when you are dressed like a real princess."

>x roland
Roland is the most attractive man you have ever laid eyes on. Too bad he's also the biggest jerk you've ever met!

>x treasure
There is more gold and precious gems here than you have ever seen before in your life.

>get treasure
No, Elizabeth. You were raised better than that.

"Roland," you say, "your clothes are really pretty, and your hair is very neat. You look like a real prince, but you are also a real jerk."

You turn around and walk out the door.



    *** And Elizabeth lived happily ever after! ***
