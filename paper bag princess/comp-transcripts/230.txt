This is the day you've always dreamed of. You are finally marrying the love of your life, Prince Roland.


Castle Garden
You are standing in the garden behind your family's castle. On this lovely fall evening, it is doing double duty as a wedding chapel.

Your betrothed, Roland, stands before you.

You can also see Father Alfred here.

>xyzzy
POOF! Your fairy godmother appears. She smiles at you and places a necklace around your neck. Then she fades out of view.

Father Alfred begins the ceremony, "We are gathered here today to witness the joining of two hearts." Roland smiles shyly at you.

>look necklace
A heart-shaped pendant on a gold chain.

"If anyone has a reason why these two should not be wed, speak now or forever hold your peace." You hold your breath for a second, wondering whether anyone will speak up. Fortunately, nobody does and you relax.

>use necklace
That's not a verb I recognize.

>wait
You beam happily at Roland.

"Who gives this woman--" You glare icily at the minister. You are nobody's property. "Ahem. Moving on," says the minister, visibly flustered. Roland looks at you questioningly, but says nothing.

>wait
You beam happily at Roland.

"Love is a wonderful thing." And so on. You're too excited to pay attention to every word.

>wait
You beam happily at Roland.

"Elizabeth, do you take Roland to be your husband?"

>wait
The minister is waiting for your answer. Please say "yes" or "no".

>wait
The minister is waiting for your answer. Please say "yes" or "no".

>wait
The minister is waiting for your answer. Please say "yes" or "no".

>maybe
That's not a verb I recognize.

>no
You shake your head. "No. I don't."

Oh.

There's a pause, and then the guests begin to murmur. The minister frowns. "Elizabeth, are you sure?" he asks. Roland just stares at you in shock. You whisper, "I'm so sorry," and run off.



    *** And they didn't get married after all! ***
