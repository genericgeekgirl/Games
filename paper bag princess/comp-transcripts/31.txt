This is the day you've always dreamed of. You are finally marrying the love of your life, Prince Roland.


Castle Garden
You are standing in the garden behind your family's castle. On this lovely fall evening, it is doing double duty as a wedding chapel.

Your betrothed, Roland, stands before you.

You can also see Father Alfred here.

>xyzzy
POOF! Your fairy godmother appears. She smiles at you and places a necklace around your neck. Then she fades out of view.

Father Alfred begins the ceremony, "We are gathered here today to witness the joining of two hearts." Roland smiles shyly at you.

>z
You beam happily at Roland.

"If anyone has a reason why these two should not be wed, speak now or forever hold your peace." You hold your breath for a second, wondering whether anyone will speak up. Fortunately, nobody does and you relax.

>z
You beam happily at Roland.

"Who gives this woman--" You glare icily at the minister. You are nobody's property. "Ahem. Moving on," says the minister, visibly flustered. Roland looks at you questioningly, but says nothing.

>z
You beam happily at Roland.

"Love is a wonderful thing." And so on. You're too excited to pay attention to every word.

>z
You beam happily at Roland.

"Elizabeth, do you take Roland to be your husband?"

>z
The minister is waiting for your answer. Please say "yes" or "no".

>z
The minister is waiting for your answer. Please say "yes" or "no".

>y
Of course you do!

The minister smiles at you and turns to Roland. "And, Roland, do you take Elizabeth to be your wife?"

Roland grins at you and exclaims, "I do!"

"I now pronounce you man and... dragon?!?" The minister's eyes go wide, seconds before he is incinerated by a burst of flame.

A large dragon flies overhead. The wedding guests scatter in every direction. You cower against Roland, but he pushes you towards the dragon and runs towards the road.

The dragon eats all the guests it can catch, and when it has had its fill, it smashes your castle to smithereens with its heavy tail and sets the remains on fire. You are nearly caught in a blaze of flame as you duck behind what used to be the stone wall of the garden. You are unhurt, but your fine gown snags on a rose bush and tears.

As the dragon finally turns to go, it catches sight of Roland, running down the road towards the river. It swoops down and smashes the bridge just as Roland is about to cross it and catches him up in its claws. The dragon flies away with your beloved prince.

Castle Ruins
This used to be your home. Now it is nothing more than a smoking pile of rubble. The smoke obscures your view of the stars, and the primary source of light is the burning remains of your furniture.

The only road away from the castle now ends abruptly at the river bank. The forest surrounds you thickly on all sides, except for an area to the north where the trees have been broken and scorched.

>dig through rubble
You dig through the piles of rubble until you find a paper bag.

>wear bag
You take the paper bag.

You quickly fashion a dress out of the gift bag. It's not as fancy as you're used to, but it'll get the job done.

You strip off the remains of your wedding gown and discard them in a pile of rubble.

You slip the makeshift dress over your head and pull it down past your hips.

Burnt Forest
There's a trail of burned trees and what appear to be teeth leading to the northeast. One tree in particular catches your eye.

>x tree
You examine the tree more closely. Someone has carved "PLUGH" into the trunk.

There is a large branch propped up against the base of the tree.

>plugh
The necklace suddenly begins to glow.

Dimly Lit Forest
You feel as if you are in a maze of twisty giant trees.

You finally emerge from the forest.

Outside the Dragon's Cave
You are standing before a large cave. The entrance has been blocked by a large wooden door.

>knock
(the cave door)
You grab the knocker and bang on the door.

The door opens and the dragon sticks its nose through the opening. It says, "Well, a princess! I love to eat princesses, but I have already eaten a whole castle today. I am a very tired dragon. Come back tomorrow." 

Then it slams the door in your face.

>talk to dragon
You can't see any such thing.

>knock
(the cave door)
You bang on the door again.

The dragon sticks its nose out the door and says, "I am sure you are very delicious, but I am rather tired and stuffed. Please do come back tomorrow."

This time, however, he does not immediately return to his cave.

>talk to dragon
"Wait!" you exclaim.

Surprised, the dragon steps entirely out of the cave, nudging the door shut with its tail.

You say, "Is it true that you are the fastest and fiercest dragon in the whole world?"

"Yes," says the dragon. Boastful fellow, isn't he?

>talk to dragon
You say, "Is it true that you are the fastest and fiercest dragon in the whole world?"

"Yes," says the dragon. Boastful fellow, isn't he?

>ask dragon about fastness
The dragon says, "I'm afraid I don't know anything about that."

>x dragon
Up close, you realize this dragon isn't actually very large, only about fifteen cubits from the tip of its nose to the spiked end of its tail. Its green scales shimmer in the glow of your necklace. Its wings are folded neatly at its sides, and a swirl of smoke escapes its nostrils.

>x wings
Even furled, the wings nearly double the size of the dragon.

>x smoke

>ask dragon about fire
"Is it true," you say, "that you can burn up ten forests with your fiery breath?"

"Oh, yes," says the dragon, and it takes a huge, deep breath and breathes out so much fire that it burns up fifty forests.

Wasn't that amazing? (Y/N)

>Y
yes
"Fantastic!" you exclaim. "Do it again!"

The dragon takes another huge breath and breathes out so much fire that it burns up one hundred forests.

Were you impressed by that display? 

>Y
yes
"Magnificent!" you shout. "Do it again!"

The dragon takes another huge breath. But this time, nothing comes out.

>ask dragon about fligh
The dragon says, "I'm afraid I don't know anything about that."

>ask dragon about flight
You say, "Dragon, is it true that you can fly around the world in just ten seconds?"

"Why, yes," says the dragon, and it jumps up and flies around the world in just ten seconds. It seems very tired when it returns.

Wasn't that amazing? 

>Y
yes
"Fantastic!" you exclaim. "Do it again!"

The dragon jumps up and flies around the whole world in just twenty seconds. When it returns, it flops down on the ground.

The dragon is so tired that he falls fast asleep.

>x dragon
The dragon is finally asleep. You should rescue Roland and leave, before it wakes up.

>rescue roland
That's not a verb I recognize.

>in
(first opening the cave door)
You step over the dragon and open the door to the cave.

The Dragon's Cave
This is where the dragon lives. Piles of treasure fill the room, reflecting light in every direction.

Your betrothed, Roland, stands before you.

Roland looks at you and says, "Elizabeth, you are a mess! You smell like ashes, your hair is all tangled, and you are wearing a dirty paper bag. Come back when you are dressed like a real princess."

>get roland
To be your lawfully wedded husband? Yes, Elizabeth. Be patient.

>kiss roland
You're really not in the mood to do that.

>talk to roland
Roland glares at you.

>yell at roland
"Roland," you say, "your clothes are really pretty, and your hair is very neat. You look like a real prince, but you are also a real toad."

You turn around and walk out the door.



    *** And Elizabeth lived happily ever after! ***
