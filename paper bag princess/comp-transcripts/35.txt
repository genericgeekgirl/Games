This is the day you've always dreamed of. You are finally marrying the love of your life, Prince Roland.


Castle Garden
You are standing in the garden behind your family's castle. On this lovely fall evening, it is doing double duty as a wedding chapel.

Your betrothed, Roland, stands before you.

You can also see Father Alfred here.

>Greet Father Alfred
Father Alfred smiles kindly at you and continues the ceremony.

Father Alfred begins the ceremony, "We are gathered here today to witness the joining of two hearts." Roland smiles shyly at you.

>Smile
You smile happily.

"If anyone has a reason why these two should not be wed, speak now or forever hold your peace." You hold your breath for a second, wondering whether anyone will speak up. Fortunately, nobody does and you relax.

>Run away
You can't see any such thing.

>Walk away
You can't see any such thing.

>Raise your hand
That's not a verb I recognize.

>Say "No"
Whom do you want to say that to?

>Say "No" to Father Alfred
Father Alfred smiles kindly at you and continues the ceremony.

"Who gives this woman--" You glare icily at the minister. You are nobody's property. "Ahem. Moving on," says the minister, visibly flustered. Roland looks at you questioningly, but says nothing.

>Punch Roland
You would never attack Roland! Except possibly with kisses.

"Love is a wonderful thing." And so on. You're too excited to pay attention to every word.

>Smile
You smile happily.

"Elizabeth, do you take Roland to be your husband?"

>Pause
That's not a verb I recognize.

>Wait
The minister is waiting for your answer. Please say "yes" or "no".

>no
You shake your head. "No. I don't."

Oh.

There's a pause, and then the guests begin to murmur. The minister frowns. "Elizabeth, are you sure?" he asks. Roland just stares at you in shock. You whisper, "I'm so sorry," and run off.



    *** And they didn't get married after all! ***
