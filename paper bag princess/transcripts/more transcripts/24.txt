This is the day you've always dreamed of. You are finally marrying the love of your life, Prince Roland.


Castle Garden
You are standing in the garden behind your family's castle. On this lovely fall evening, it is doing double duty as a wedding chapel.

Your betrothed, Roland, stands before you.

You can also see Father Alfred here.

>x me
You are young and beautiful, too lovely to be described in mere words.

You are wearing a wedding gown and a sparkly gold crown.

Father Alfred begins the ceremony, "We are gathered here today to witness the joining of two hearts." Roland smiles shyly at you.

>e
You can't leave yet! The ceremony hasn't ended.

"If anyone has a reason why these two should not be wed, speak now or forever hold your peace." You hold your breath for a second, wondering whether anyone will speak up. Fortunately, nobody does and you relax.

>x castle
It's a modestly-sized building fashioned out of grey stones. You have lived here your entire life.

"Who gives this woman--" You glare icily at the minister. You are nobody's property. "Ahem. Moving on," says the minister, visibly flustered. Roland looks at you questioningly, but says nothing.

>x roland
Roland is the most attractive man you have ever laid eyes on.

"Love is a wonderful thing." And so on. You're too excited to pay attention to every word.

>i
You are carrying a bouquet.

"Elizabeth, do you take Roland to be your husband?"

>smell bouquet
You hold the bouquet up to your face and breathe in deeply.

>x it
The minister is waiting for your answer. Please say "yes" or "no".

>no
You shake your head. "No. I don't."

Oh.

There's a pause, and then the guests begin to murmur. The minister frowns. "Elizabeth, are you sure?" he asks. Roland just stares at you in shock. You whisper, "I'm so sorry," and run off.



    *** And they didn't get married after all! ***
