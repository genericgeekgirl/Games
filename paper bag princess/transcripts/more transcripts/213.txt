You fashion a torch from the branch and the remains of your wedding gown.

>x me
You are young and beautiful, too lovely to be described in mere words. You are, however, in dire need of a bath and a change of clothes.

You are wearing a gift bag that has been fashioned into a rather respectable dress and a tarnished gold crown.

>x crown
Your gold crown. It's looking a little worse for the wear.

Castle Ruins
This used to be your home. Now it is nothing more than a smoking pile of rubble. The smoke obscures your view of the stars, and the primary source of light is the burning remains of your furniture.

The only road away from the castle now ends abruptly at the river bank. The forest surrounds you thickly on all sides, except for an area to the north where the trees have been broken and scorched.

>look river
The water is very deep here, and it moves quickly. Your father used to scare you with stories of sharks, although you have never actually seen one.

>taste river
You taste nothing unexpected.

>put torch in river
That can't contain things.

You think you can make out the leg of a chair somewhere in that mess. It's mostly just a blaze of fire.

>put down torch
You ought to hold on to that.

>torch
That's not a verb I recognize.

>torch in fire
That's not a verb I recognize.

>put torch in fire
The torch needs something else.

You're pretty certain he was joking about the sharks. But you would rather not take the chance.

Ok.

>plugh
POOF! Your fairy godmother appears. "Tsk," she says. "Poor girl. I'm not sure I can help you with this one." She pauses and rummages around in her pockets, pulling out a vial. She hands it to you. "This is the best I can do. Use it wisely." Then she vanishes, as quickly as she appeared.

>look vial
In the vial is an oily black liquid.

>smell liquid
The vial isn't open.

>open vial
You open the vial.

>smell liquid
It's pretty foul-smelling.

>taste liquid
As you bring vial towards your mouth, you catch a whiff of the liquid inside and gag. Drinking that seems like a bad idea.

>put liquid on torch
You pour the oily black liquid onto the torch and discard the empty vial.

>look vial
You can't see any such thing.

>put torch in fire
You light the torch with the flames.
