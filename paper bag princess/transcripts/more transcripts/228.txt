This is the day you've always dreamed of. You are finally marrying the love of your life, Prince Roland.


Castle Garden
You are standing in the garden behind your family's castle. On this lovely fall evening, it is doing double duty as a wedding chapel.

Your betrothed, Roland, stands before you.

You can also see Father Alfred here.

>kill alfred
Violence isn't the answer to this one.

Father Alfred begins the ceremony, "We are gathered here today to witness the joining of two hearts." Roland smiles shyly at you.

>look up
You see nothing unexpected in that direction.

"If anyone has a reason why these two should not be wed, speak now or forever hold your peace." You hold your breath for a second, wondering whether anyone will speak up. Fortunately, nobody does and you relax.

>look around
You can't see any such thing.

>wait
You beam happily at Roland.

"Who gives this woman--" You glare icily at the minister. You are nobody's property. "Ahem. Moving on," says the minister, visibly flustered. Roland looks at you questioningly, but says nothing.

>admire roland
That's not a verb I recognize.

>look at roland
Roland is the most attractive man you have ever laid eyes on.

"Love is a wonderful thing." And so on. You're too excited to pay attention to every word.

>look around
You can't see any such thing.

>look
Castle Garden
You are standing in the garden behind your family's castle. On this lovely fall evening, it is doing double duty as a wedding chapel.

Your betrothed, Roland, stands before you.

You can also see Father Alfred here.

"Elizabeth, do you take Roland to be your husband?"

>of course I do
That's not a verb I recognize.

>yep
Of course you do!

The minister smiles at you and turns to Roland. "And, Roland, do you take Elizabeth to be your wife?"

Roland grins at you and exclaims, "I do!"

"I now pronounce you man and... dragon?!?" The minister's eyes go wide, seconds before he is incinerated by a burst of flame.

A large dragon flies overhead. The wedding guests scatter in every direction. You cower against Roland, but he pushes you towards the dragon and runs towards the road.

The dragon eats all the guests it can catch, and when it has had its fill, it smashes your castle to smithereens with its heavy tail and sets the remains on fire. You are nearly caught in a blaze of flame as you duck behind what used to be the stone wall of the garden. You are unhurt, but your fine gown snags on a rose bush and tears.

As the dragon finally turns to go, it catches sight of Roland, running down the road towards the river. It swoops down and smashes the bridge just as Roland is about to cross it and catches him up in its claws. The dragon flies away with your beloved prince.

The Paper Bag Princess
An interactive fairy tale by Adri
Release 1 / Serial number 131021 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) 

Castle Ruins
This used to be your home. Now it is nothing more than a smoking pile of rubble. The smoke obscures your view of the stars, and the primary source of light is the burning remains of your furniture.

The only road away from the castle now ends abruptly at the river bank. The forest surrounds you thickly on all sides, except for an area to the north where the trees have been broken and scorched.

>examine castle
These piles of stones and wood used to be your home. You catch a glimpse of something colorful hidden in one of the piles.

>look pile
These piles of stones and wood used to be your home. You catch a glimpse of something colorful hidden in one of the piles.

>look colorful
You can't quite make it out from here. Why don't you try digging through the rubble?

>dig through rubble
You dig through the piles of rubble until you find a paper bag.

>open paper bag
That's not something you can open.

>look paper bag
It's a gift bag made out of paper. It looks like it used to have polka dots on it, but now it's just scorched.

>take paper bag
You take the paper bag.

>look self
You are young and beautiful, too lovely to be described in mere words. You are, however, in dire need of a bath and a change of clothes.

You are wearing a handful of rags and a tarnished gold crown.

>look around
You can't see any such thing.

You slip the makeshift dress over your head and pull it down past your hips.

POOF! Your fairy godmother appears. "Tsk," she says. "Poor girl. I'm not sure I can help you with this one." She pauses and rummages around in her pockets, pulling out a vial. She hands it to you. "This is the best I can do. Use it wisely." Then she vanishes, as quickly as she appeared.

>x vial
In the vial is an oily black liquid.

Q

Dimly Lit Forest

>x torch
It is a torch crafted from a branch and the remains of your wedding gown. It is on fire.

>w

Dimly Lit Forest
You feel as if you are in a giant maze of twisting trees.

>w
As you emerge from the forest, the torch suddenly fizzles out.

Outside the Dragon's Cave
You are standing before a large cave. The entrance has been blocked by a large wooden door.

>
I beg your pardon?

>light door
This dangerous act would achieve little.

>x door
The large door almost perfectly fills in the natural opening in the rock. There is a golden knocker in the shape of a dragon's tail about a foot above your head.

>use knocker
That's not a verb I recognize.

>knock
(the cave door)
You grab the knocker and bang on the door.

The door opens and the dragon sticks its nose through the opening. It says, "Well, a princess! I love to eat princesses, but I have already eaten a whole castle today. I am a very tired dragon. Come back tomorrow." 

Then it slams the door in your face.

>knock
(the cave door)
You bang on the door again.

The dragon sticks its nose out the door and says, "I am sure you are very delicious, but I am rather tired and stuffed. Please do come back tomorrow."

This time, however, he does not immediately return to his cave.

>talk
What do you want to talk to?

>talk to dragon
"Wait!" you exclaim.

Surprised, the dragon steps entirely out of the cave, nudging the door shut with its tail.

You say, "Is it true that you are the fastest and fiercest dragon in the whole world?"

"Yes," says the dragon. Boastful fellow, isn't he?

>talk to dragon
You say, "Is it true that you are the fastest and fiercest dragon in the whole world?"

"Yes," says the dragon. Boastful fellow, isn't he?

>goad dragon
That's not a verb I recognize.

>lie to dragon
That's not a verb I recognize.

>trick dragon
Dragons are well known for breathing FIRE and their ability to FLY. Maybe you could try asking about one of those.

>ask dragon about fire
"Is it true," you say, "that you can burn up ten forests with your fiery breath?"

"Oh, yes," says the dragon, and it takes a huge, deep breath and breathes out so much fire that it burns up fifty forests.

Were you impressed by that display? (Y/N)

>N
no
Apparently it takes a lot to impress you! But you force yourself to look delighted as you shout, "Do it again!"

The dragon takes another huge breath and breathes out so much fire that it burns up one hundred forests.

Wasn't that amazing? 

>Y
yes
"Fantastic!" you exclaim. "Do it again!"

The dragon takes another huge breath. But this time, nothing comes out.

>ask dragon about fly
You say, "Dragon, is it true that you can fly around the world in just ten seconds?"

"Why, yes," says the dragon, and it jumps up and flies around the world in just ten seconds. It seems very tired when it returns.

Were you impressed by that display? 

>Y
yes
"Magnificent!" you shout. "Do it again!"

The dragon says, "I'm afraid I don't know anything about that."

The dragon is so tired that he falls fast asleep.

>go inside
(first opening the cave door)
You step over the dragon and open the door to the cave.

The Dragon's Cave
This is where the dragon lives. Piles of treasure fill the room, reflecting light in every direction.

Your betrothed, Roland, stands before you.

Roland looks at you and says, "Elizabeth, you are a mess! You smell like ashes, your hair is all tangled, and you are wearing a dirty paper bag. Come back when you are dressed like a real princess."

>hit roland
You slap Roland!

"Roland," you say, "your clothes are really pretty, and your hair is very neat. You look like a real prince, but you are also a real toad."

You turn around and walk out the door.



    *** And Elizabeth lived happily ever after! ***

> amusing

Have you tried...
- casting xyzzy during the wedding ceremony?
- marrying another princess?
- not getting married?
- singing? (You might find it quite soothing.)
- dying? (Not particularly soothing, to anyone involved.)

You can't see any such thing.

>take treasure
No, Elizabeth. You were raised better than that.

>look roland
Roland is the most attractive man you have ever laid eyes on. Too bad he's also the biggest bum you've ever met!

>kill roland
You slap Roland!

"Roland," you say, "your clothes are really pretty, and your hair is very neat. You look like a real prince, but you are also a real toad."

You turn around and walk out the door.
