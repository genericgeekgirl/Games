"I especially would have appreciated more conversation options, both with the dragon and with Prince Roland.  The other thing I'm feeling unfulfilled about is the teeth. About halfway through the game, Elizabeth encounters a trail of teeth, 'in a variety of shapes and sizes, most of which do not appear to be human.' I'm so curious about these teeth! I wasn't able to ask the dragon about them or find out anything else. Author, you've left me hanging!"

The ending was rather abrupt. That final confrontation could have tied up the theme more satisfactorily if there had been more to it.

I had two real design gripes. First, I didn't like the (pseudo-) maze. In some ways, I think, a pseudo-maze is worse than a real one, because it's not interesting on any level: there's nothing to see, and nothing to solve. I know why Adri wanted to give the impression of a long journey, but I think this was a poor choice of way to do that, and that we ought to have had either real locations (with things to look at) or a cut-scene. It's been slightly improved in the update, but I think this could do with some attention when the comp is over.

The second problem was right at the end with the conversation with the dragon. I had trouble with that (as others did) identifying the triggers I needed, which has again been much improved in the update, so all is now smooth. But it would have been really cool if the dragon were equipped, beyond the few topics that really matter, with a wide range of subjects. It would have added interactivity, which the story otherwise somewhat lacks, and character and, I think, charm.
