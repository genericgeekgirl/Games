Adam Myers says "I found it unfortunate that Elizabeth talks the dragon into incinerating 150 forests. Perhaps this seemed less calamitous in 1980, just as 'bum' presumably seemed acceptable as an insult. The game claims to be a loose adaptation and quietly replaces 'bum' with 'jerk'. I'd like my nephew to learn about gender equality, but also to value the environment; It would be wonderful if this detail, too, could be changed."

my response: "My hope is to have some alternate solutions, although possibly not until post-comp. There were originally going to be things in the forest that can affect the ending, such as plants that can help induce sleepiness in the dragon, or shinies which you can bribe or otherwise distract him with. Singing would also induce sleepiness (this is currently hinted by the response to >sing, which refers to a lullaby your mother used to sing to you), and I'd really like to have an option where you simply befriend the dragon."

Adam also says "Finally, a player who hasn't read the book will probably spend quite a bit of time asking the dragon about unimplemented topics, so if you have time, maybe you could implement a more interesting response to that for a post-comp version?"
