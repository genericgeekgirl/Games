This is the day you've always dreamed of. You are finally marrying the love of your life, Prince Roland.


Castle Garden
You are standing in the garden behind your family's castle. On this lovely fall evening, it is doing double duty as a wedding chapel.

Your betrothed, Roland, stands before you.

You can also see Father Alfred here.

>look at roland
Roland is the most attractive man you have ever laid eyes on.

Father Alfred begins the ceremony, "We are gathered here today to witness the joining of two hearts." Roland smiles shyly at you.

>look at alfred
Father Alfred has been your family's minister for as long as you can remember.

"If anyone has a reason why these two should not be wed, speak now or forever hold your peace." You hold your breath for a second, wondering whether anyone will speak up. Fortunately, nobody does and you relax.

>wait
You beam happily at Roland.

"Who gives this woman--" You glare icily at the minister. You are nobody's property. "Ahem. Moving on," says the minister, visibly flustered. Roland looks at you questioningly, but says nothing.

>glare at roland
That's not a verb I recognize.

>wait
You beam happily at Roland.

"Love is a wonderful thing." And so on. You're too excited to pay attention to every word.

>wait
You beam happily at Roland.

"Elizabeth, do you take Roland to be your husband?"

>i do
Of course you do!

The minister smiles at you and turns to Roland. "And, Roland, do you take Elizabeth to be your wife?"

Roland grins at you and exclaims, "I do!"

"I now pronounce you man and... dragon?!?" The minister's eyes go wide, seconds before he is incinerated by a burst of flame.

A large dragon flies overhead. The wedding guests scatter in every direction. You cower against Roland, but he pushes you towards the dragon and runs towards the road.

The dragon eats all the guests it can catch, and when it has had its fill, it smashes your castle to smithereens with its heavy tail and sets the remains on fire. You are nearly caught in a blaze of flame as you duck behind what used to be the stone wall of the garden. You are unhurt, but your fine gown snags on a rose bush and tears.

As the dragon finally turns to go, it catches sight of Roland, running down the road towards the river. It swoops down and smashes the bridge just as Roland is about to cross it and catches him up in its claws. The dragon flies away with your beloved prince.

Release 1 / Serial number 131014 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) 

Castle Ruins
This used to be your home. Now it is nothing more than a smoking pile of rubble. The smoke obscures your view of the stars, and the primary source of light is the burning remains of your furniture.

The only road away from the castle now ends abruptly at the river bank. The forest surrounds you thickly on all sides, except for an area to the north where the trees have been broken and scorched.

You quickly fashion a dress out of the gift bag. It's not as fancy as you're used to, but it'll get the job done.

Princess Elizabeth is about to marry the love of her life when a dragon attacks the castle and kidnaps her betrothed.

The Paper Bag Princess is loosely based upon the book of the same name by Robert Munsch. Permission to write the game was requested from and granted by Mister Munsch himself.

The cover art of Elizabeth was graciously provided by Stacey, aka "iduck" on deviantART.

Thank you so much to my beta testers: Brendan Desilets, Dan Shiovitz, Dan Kelly, David Sturgis, Doug Orleans, Emily Boegheim, Jason McIntosh, Johnny Rivera, Kevin Jackson-Mead, Matthew Miller, Scott Snyder and Z Goddard. Post-release feedback from Adam Myers, Andrew Schultz, E Joyce, Felix Plesoianu and Victor Gijsbers was also particularly helpful to me.

The > sign is where the game says, "Okay, what do you want to do now?"  You may respond by typing an instruction -- usually an imperative verb, possibly followed by prepositions and objects.  So, for instance, LOOK, LOOK AT FISH, TAKE FISH.

Examine every object and look at everything in your inventory. Open all the doors you can find, and go through them. Look inside all closed containers. Make sure you've exhausted all the options in your environment. 

Try out all your senses. If the game mentions texture, odor, or sound, try touching, smelling, listening to, or tasting objects.

Be thorough. If you still can't figure out what to do, try opening windows, looking under beds, etc. Sometimes objects are well-hidden.

Rephrase. If there's something you want to do, but the game doesn't seem to understand you, try alternative wordings. 

Try variations. Sometimes an action doesn't work, but does produce some kind of unusual result. These are often indications that you're on the right track, even if you haven't figured out quite the right approach yet. Pressing the red button alone may only cause a grinding noise from inside the wall, so perhaps pressing the blue and then the red will open the secret door.

Consider the genre of the game. Mysteries, romances, and thrillers all have their own types of action and motivation. What are you trying to do, and how do conventional characters go about doing that? What's the right sort of behavior for a detective/romance heroine/spy?

Play with someone else. Two heads are often better than one. If that doesn't work, try emailing the author or (better yet) posting a request for hints on the newsgroup rec.games.int-fiction.  For best results, put the name of the game you want help with in the subject line; then leave a page or so of blank spoiler space (so that no one will read about where you got to in the game unless they've already played it), and describe your problem as clearly as possible.  Someone will probably be able to tell you how to get around it.

POOF! Your fairy godmother appears. "Tsk," she says. "Poor girl. I'm not sure I can help you with this one." She pauses and rummages around in her pockets, pulling out a vial. She hands it to you. "This is the best I can do. Use it wisely." Then she vanishes, as quickly as she appeared.

Outside the Dragon's Cave
You are standing before a large cave. The entrance has been blocked by a large wooden door.

>l door
The large door almost perfectly fills in the natural opening in the rock. There is a golden knocker in the shape of a dragon's tail about a foot above your head.

>open door
The door is locked. Perhaps you should try knocking.

>knock door
You grab the knocker and bang on the door.

The door opens and the dragon sticks its nose through the opening. It says, "Well, a princess! I love to eat princesses, but I have already eaten a whole castle today. I am a very tired dragon. Come back tomorrow." 

Then it slams the door in your face.

>knock door
You bang on the door again.

The dragon sticks its nose out the door and says, "I am sure you are very delicious, but I am rather tired and stuffed. Please do come back tomorrow."

This time, however, he does not immediately return to his cave.

>l dragon
Up close, you realize this dragon isn't actually very large, only about fifteen cubits from the tip of its nose to the spiked end of its tail. Its wings are folded neatly at its sides, and a swirl of smoke escapes its nostrils.

You hear a faint sound in the distance. Help does not arrive.

>ask dragon about prince
"Wait!" you exclaim.

Surprised, the dragon steps entirely out of the cave, nudging the door shut with its tail.

The dragon says, "Oh, yes. I love to eat royals. But I have already eaten a whole castle today, so I am saving your prince for later."

"Where is he?" you cry.

"I cannot tell you that," says the dragon, although it casts a nervous look towards the cave.

>ask dragon about eating
The dragon says, "I'm afraid I don't know anything about that."

>ask dragon about food
The dragon says, "I'm afraid I don't know anything about that."

>ask dragon about cave
The dragon says, "That is my home, and you are not welcome in there."

>ask dragon about castle
The dragon says, "That's very kind of you to offer, but I have already eaten a whole castle today."

"That was my home!" you shout.

The dragon shrugs. It doesn't seem particularly inclined to apologize.

>ask dragon about home
The dragon says, "I'm afraid I don't know anything about that."

>ask dragon about wife
The dragon says, "I'm afraid I don't know anything about that."

>ask dragon about wedding
The dragon says, "I'm afraid I don't know anything about that."

>ask dragon about speaking
The dragon says, "I'm afraid I don't know anything about that."

>ask dragon about wings
You say, "Dragon, is it true that you can fly around the world in just ten seconds?"

"Why, yes," says the dragon, and it jumps up and flies around the world in just ten seconds. It seems very tired when it returns.

Were you impressed by that display? (Y/N)

>Y
yes
"Fantastic!" you exclaim. "Do it again!"

The dragon jumps up and flies around the whole world in just twenty seconds. When it returns, it flops down on the ground.

>l dragon
Up close, you realize this dragon isn't actually very large, only about fifteen cubits from the tip of its nose to the spiked end of its tail. Its wings are folded neatly at its sides, and a swirl of smoke escapes its nostrils.

>ask dragon about tired
The dragon says, "I'm afraid I don't know anything about that."

>ask dragon about 20 seconds
The dragon says, "I'm afraid I don't know anything about that."

>ask dragon about flying
The dragon is too tired to stand up.

>open door
The door is locked. Perhaps you should try knocking.

>knock door
You already have the dragon's attention.

>l
Outside the Dragon's Cave
You are standing before a large cave. The entrance has been blocked by a large wooden door.

You can see a dragon here.

>ask dragon to unlock door
I didn't understand that sentence.

>l door
The large door almost perfectly fills in the natural opening in the rock. There is a golden knocker in the shape of a dragon's tail about a foot above your head.

>sneak past door
That's not a verb I recognize.

>climb dragon
I don't think much is to be achieved by that.

>climb cave
You have always been a great climber, but there is no time for that.

>enter cave
The dragon is blocking the doorway and will not allow you to pass.

>ask dragon about flying
The dragon is too tired to stand up.

>ask dragon about tired
The dragon says, "I'm afraid I don't know anything about that."

Q

Outside the Dragon's Cave
You are standing before a large cave. The entrance has been blocked by a large wooden door.

You can see a dragon here.

>ask dragon about fire
"Is it true," you say, "that you can burn up ten forests with your fiery breath?"

"Oh, yes," says the dragon, and it takes a huge, deep breath and breathes out so much fire that it burns up fifty forests.

Wasn't that amazing? 

>Y
yes
"Magnificent!" you shout. "Do it again!"

The dragon takes another huge breath and breathes out so much fire that it burns up one hundred forests.

Were you impressed by that display? 

>Y
yes
"Fantastic!" you exclaim. "Do it again!"

The dragon takes another huge breath. But this time, nothing comes out.

The dragon is so tired that he falls fast asleep.

>
I beg your pardon?

>shout to roland
I only understood you as far as wanting to shout.

>shout
You whisper very softly, "Hey, dragon."

The dragon doesn't stir.

The dragon is finally asleep. You should rescue Roland and leave, before it wakes up.

>shout to roland
I only understood you as far as wanting to shout.

>shout
You lift the dragon's ear and put your head right inside. You shout as loudly as you can, "Hey, dragon!"

The dragon doesn't react.

>shout
The dragon seems to be fast asleep. You could probably sneak right past it now.

You can't see any such thing.

Outside the Dragon's Cave
You are standing before a large cave. The entrance has been blocked by a large wooden door.

You can see a dragon here.

>in

The Dragon's Cave
This is where the dragon lives. Piles of treasure fill the room, reflecting light in every direction.

Your betrothed, Roland, stands before you.

Roland looks at you and says, "Elizabeth, you are a mess! You smell like ashes, your hair is all tangled, and you are wearing a dirty paper bag. Come back when you are dressed like a real princess."

>out
"Roland," you say, "your clothes are really pretty, and your hair is very neat. You look like a real prince, but you are also a real toad."

You turn around and walk out the door.



    *** And Elizabeth lived happily ever after! ***
