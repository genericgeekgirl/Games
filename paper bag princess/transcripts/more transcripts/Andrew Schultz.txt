I enjoyed your game & my main technical concern is that the necklace gets lost in the shuffle a bit. Semicolons note other things I had questions about.

I was worried going into the forest that my light source would go out & I'd have liked a bit more indication of what would happen. E.g. your fairy godmother helped you, and maybe she should say 'It will last just long enough' or something.

That allows for narrative which I think the player would enjoy when stuck in the forest e.g. 'You have to be close to the dragon's cave.'

I got stuck finding what to ask the dragon about as well, but I could and should have figured it out. I'd have liked to see hints in response to this as well as an AMUSING section at the end--because I have a feeling this game put various touches I missed, and I want to see them.

>shit
Real princesses do not use such language.

Father Alfred begins the ceremony, "We are gathered here today to witness the joining of two hearts." Roland smiles shyly at you.

>; :)
That's not a verb I recognize.

>s
You can't leave yet! The ceremony hasn't ended.

"If anyone has a reason why these two should not be wed, speak now or forever hold your peace." You hold your breath for a second, wondering whether anyone will speak up. Fortunately, nobody does and you relax.

>w
You can't leave yet! The ceremony hasn't ended.

"Who gives this woman--" You glare icily at the minister. You are nobody's property. "Ahem. Moving on," says the minister, visibly flustered. Roland looks at you questioningly, but says nothing.

>sleep
You aren't feeling especially drowsy.

"Love is a wonderful thing." And so on. You're too excited to pay attention to every word.

>wave
You wave, feeling foolish.

"Elizabeth, do you take Roland to be your husband?"

>jump
The minister is waiting for your answer. Please say "yes" or "no".

>z

>z
The minister is waiting for your answer. Please say "yes" or "no".

>yes
Of course you do!

The minister smiles at you and turns to Roland. "And, Roland, do you take Elizabeth to be your wife?"

Roland grins at you and exclaims, "I do!"

"I now pronounce you man and... dragon?!?" The minister's eyes go wide, seconds before he is incinerated by a burst of flame.

A large dragon flies overhead. The wedding guests scatter in every direction. You cower against Roland, but he pushes you towards the dragon and runs towards the road.

The dragon eats all the guests it can catch, and when it has had its fill, it smashes your castle to smithereens with its heavy tail and sets the remains on fire. You are nearly caught in a blaze of flame as you duck behind what used to be the stone wall of the garden. You are unhurt, but your fine gown snags on a rose bush and tears.

As the dragon finally turns to go, it catches sight of Roland, running down the road towards the river. It swoops down and smashes the bridge just as Roland is about to cross it and catches him up in its claws. The dragon flies away with your beloved prince.

You shake your head. "No. I don't."

Oh.

There's a pause, and then the guests begin to murmur. The minister frowns. "Elizabeth, are you sure?" he asks. Roland just stares at you in shock. You whisper, "I'm so sorry," and run off.

You are standing in the garden behind your family's castle. On this lovely fall evening, it is doing double duty as a wedding chapel.

Your betrothed, Roland, stands before you.

Princess Elizabeth is about to marry the love of her life when a dragon attacks the castle and kidnaps her betrothed.

The Paper Bag Princess is loosely based upon the book of the same name by Robert Munsch. Permission to write the game was requested from and granted by Mister Munsch himself.

The cover art of Elizabeth was graciously provided by Stacey, aka "iduck" on deviantART.

Thank you so much to my beta testers: Brendan Desilets, Dan Shiovitz, Dan Kelly, David Sturgis, Doug Orleans, Emily Boegheim, Johnny Rivera, Kevin Jackson-Mead, Matthew Miller, Scott Snyder and Z Goddard.

Then it slams the door in your face.

>ask about cave
The dragon says, "That is my home, and you are not welcome in there."

>ask about entrance
The dragon says, "That is my home, and you are not welcome in there."

>ask about castle
The dragon says, "That's very kind of you to offer, but I have already eaten a whole castle today."

"That was my home!" you shout.

The dragon shrugs. It doesn't seem particularly inclined to apologize.

>ask about wedding
The dragon says, "I'm afraid I don't know anything about that."

>ask about me
The dragon says, "I love to eat princesses, but I have already eaten a whole castle today. Come back tomorrow."

>ask about roland
The dragon says, "Oh, yes. I love to eat royals. But I have already eaten a whole castle today, so I am saving your prince for later."

"Where is he?" you cry.

"I cannot tell you that," says the dragon, although it casts a nervous look towards the cave.

>ask about later
The dragon says, "I'm afraid I don't know anything about that."

>ask about eating
The dragon says, "I'm afraid I don't know anything about that."

>ask about eat

Outside the Dragon's Cave
You are standing before a large cave. The entrance has been blocked by a large wooden door.

You can see a dragon here.

>ask dragon about fire
"Is it true," you say, "that you can burn up ten forests with your fiery breath?"

"Oh, yes," says the dragon, and it takes a huge, deep breath and breathes out so much fire that it burns up fifty forests.

Were you impressed by that display?

>no
Apparently it takes a lot to impress you! But you force yourself to look delighted as you shout, "Do it again!"

The dragon takes another huge breath and breathes out so much fire that it burns up one hundred forests.

Wasn't that amazing?

>no
Apparently it takes a lot to impress you! But you force yourself to look delighted as you shout, "Do it again!"

The dragon takes another huge breath. But this time, nothing comes out.

>ask about flight
You say, "Dragon, is it true that you can fly around the world in just ten seconds?"

"Why, yes," says the dragon, and it jumps up and flies around the world in just ten seconds. It seems very tired when it returns.

Were you impressed by that display?

>no
Apparently it takes a lot to impress you! But you force yourself to look delighted as you shout, "Do it again!"

The dragon jumps up and flies around the whole world in just twenty seconds. When it returns, it flops down on the ground.

The dragon is so tired that he falls fast asleep.

>in
(first opening the cave door)

The Dragon's Cave
This is where the dragon lives. Piles of treasure fill the room, reflecting light in every direction.

Your betrothed, Roland, stands before you.

Roland looks at you and says, "Elizabeth, you are a mess! You smell like ashes, your hair is all tangled, and you are wearing a dirty paper bag. Come back when you are dressed like a real princess."

>kiss roland
You're really not in the mood to do that.

>remove bag
You remove the gift bag, folding it carefully.

>i
You are carrying a torch and a paper bag.

>x me
You are young and beautiful, too lovely to be described in mere words. You are, however, in dire need of a bath and a change of clothes.

You are stark naked, save for a tarnished gold crown.

>give all to roland
You can't use multiple objects with that verb.

>give torch to roland
Roland glares at you.

>x torch
It is a torch crafted from a branch and the remains of your wedding gown.

>remove gown
You can't see any such thing.

>take gown
You can't see any such thing.

>get branch
You already have that.

>untie torch
That's not a verb I recognize.

>give crown to roland
(first taking the tarnished gold crown off)
You should leave that on. A princess should never be without her crown.

>x crown
Your gold crown. It's looking a little worse for the wear.

>e
"Roland," you say, "your clothes are really pretty, and your hair is very neat. You look like a real prince, but you are also a real jerk."

You turn around and walk out the door.

No, Elizabeth. You were raised better than that.

Princess Elizabeth is about to marry the love of her life when a dragon attacks the castle and kidnaps her betrothed.

The Paper Bag Princess is loosely based upon the book of the same name by Robert Munsch. Permission to write the game was requested from and granted by Mister Munsch himself.

The cover art of Elizabeth was graciously provided by Stacey, aka "iduck" on deviantART.

Thank you so much to my beta testers: Brendan Desilets, Dan Shiovitz, Dan Kelly, David Sturgis, Doug Orleans, Emily Boegheim, Johnny Rivera, Kevin Jackson-Mead, Matthew Miller, Scott Snyder and Z Goddard.
