>x garden
You can't see any such thing.

>x castle
You can't see any such thing.

>x roland
Roland is the most attractive man you have ever laid eyes on.

Father Alfred begins the ceremony, "We are gathered here today to witness the
joining of two hearts." Roland smiles shyly at you.

>i
You are carrying a bouquet.

"If anyone has a reason why these two should not be wed, speak now or forever
hold your peace." You hold your breath for a second, wondering whether anyone
will speak up. Fortunately, nobody does and you relax.

>x bouquet
Your bouquet contains a collection of purple and orange flowers, tied up with a
white ribbon. You don't even know what most of those flowers are called.

"Who gives this woman--" You glare icily at the minister. You are nobody's
property. "Ahem. Moving on," says the minister, visibly flustered. Roland looks
at you questioningly, but says nothing.

>smell bouquet
You smell nothing unexpected.

"Love is a wonderful thing." And so on. You're too excited to pay attention to
every word.

>throw bouqet
You can't see any such thing.

>o bouquet
It is not time to throw the bouquet yet.

"Elizabeth, do you take Roland to be your husband?"

>yes
Of course you do!

The minister smiles at you and turns to Roland. "And, Roland, do you take
Elizabeth to be your wife?"

Roland grins at you and exclaims, "I do!".

"I now pronounce you man and... dragon?!?" The minister's eyes go wide, seconds
before he is incinerated by a burst of flame.

A large dragon flies overhead. The wedding guests scatter in every direction.
You cower against Roland, but he pushes you towards the dragon and runs towards
the road.

The dragon eats all the guests it can catch, and when it has had its fill, it
smashes your castle to smithereens with its heavy tail and sets the remains on
fire. You are nearly caught in a blaze of flame as you duck behind what used to
be the stone wall of the garden. You are unhurt, but your fine gown snags on a
rose bush and tears.

As the dragon finally turns to go, it catches sight of Roland, running down the
road towards the river. It swoops down and smashes the bridge just as Roland is
about to cross it and catches he up in its claws. The dragon flies away with
your beloved prince.

An interactive fairy tale by Adri

Castle Ruins
This used to be your home. Now it is nothing more than a smoking pile of rubble.
The smoke obscures your view of the stars, and the primary source of light is
the burning remains of your furniture.

The only road away from the castle now ends abruptly at the river bank. The
forest surrounds you thickly on all sides, except for an area to the north where
the trees have been broken and scorched.

The flames burn brightly.

>x rubble
These piles of brick and wood used to be your home.

>search it
You dig through the piles of rubble until you find a paper bag.

It's a gift bag made out of paper. It looks like it used to have polka dots on
it, but now it's just scorched.

>look in it
You find nothing of interest.

That's not a verb I recognize.

where the trees have been broken and scorched.

>i
You are carrying a paper bag.

>wear paper bag
You quickly fashion a dress out of the gift bag. It's not as fancy as you're
used to, but it'll get the job done.

You strip off the remains of your wedding gown.

You slip the makeshift dress over your head and pull it down past your hips.

>i
You are carrying a handful of rags.

>x rags
The tattered remains of your wedding gown.

Burnt Forest
There's a trail of burned trees and what appear to be teeth leading to the
northeast. One tree in particular catches your eye.

>x teeth
Yes. Those are definitely teeth.

>touch teeth
You feel nothing unexpected.

You examine the tree more closely. Someone has carved "PLUGH" into the trunk.

>plugh
POOF! Your fairy godmother appears. "Tsk," she says. "Poor girl. I'm not sure I
can help you with this one." She pauses and rummages around in her pockets,
pulling out a vial. She hands it to you. "This is the best I can do. Use it
wisely." Then she vanishes, as quickly as she appeared.

>x vial
 It's a vial of thick, black liquid.

>smell it
The vial isn't open.

>open vial
You open the vial, revealing an oily black liquid.

>smell liquid
It's pretty foul-smelling.

The door opens and the dragon sticks his nose through the opening. He says,
"Well, a princess! I love to eat princesses, but I have already eaten a whole
castle today. I am a very tired dragon. Come back tomorrow." 

Then he slams the door in your face.

>knock

delicious, but I am rather tired and stuffed. Please do come back tomorrow."

This time he pauses a moment before slamming the door.

You already have the dragon's attention.

cubits from the tip of its nose to the spiked end of its tail. Its green scales
shimmer in the glow of your torch.

"Wait!" you exclaim.

The dragon rolls his eyes and steps entirely out of the cave, nudging the door
shut with his tail.

"Is it true," you say, "that you can burn up ten forests with your fiery
breath?"

"Oh, yes", says the dragon, and he takes a huge, deep breath and breathes out so
much fire that he burns up fifty forests.


Wasn't that amazing?


"Fantastic!" you exclaim. "Do it again!"

The dragon takes another huge breath and breathes out so much fire that he burns
up one hundred forests.

Outside the Dragon's Cave
You are standing before a large cave. The entrance has been blocked by a large
wooden door.

You can see a dragon here.

>t dragon
The dragon says, "I'm afraid I don't know anything about that."

>talk
What do you want to talk to?

>dragon
You say, "Is it true that you are the smartest and fiercest dragon in the whole
world?"

"Yes", says the dragon. Boastful fellow, isn't he?

>flatter dragon
Maybe you could try asking the dragon about fire or flight.

>ask dragon about flight
You say, "Dragon, is it true that you can fly around the world in just ten
seconds?"

"Why, yes," says the dragon, and he jumps up and flies around the world in just
ten seconds. He seems very tired when he returns.


Wasn't that amazing?


"Fantastic!" you exclaim. "Do it again!"

The dragon jumps up and flies around the whole world in just twenty seconds.
When he returns, he flops down on the ground.


The dragon is so tired that he falls fast asleep.

>x dragon
The dragon is finally asleep. You should rescue Roland and leave, before it
wakes up.

>open door
You open the cave door.

>in

The Dragon's Cave
This is where the dragon lives. Piles of treasure fill the room, reflecting
light in every direction.

Your betrothed, Roland, stands before you.

Roland looks at you and says, "Elizabeth, you are a mess! You smell like ashes,
your hair is all tangled, and you are wearing a dirty paper bag. Come back when
you are dressed like a real princess."

>x roland
Roland is the most attractive man you have ever laid eyes on. Too bad he's also
the biggest jerk you've ever met!

>hit roland
You slap Roland! "Roland," you say, "your clothes are really pretty, and your
hair is very neat. You look like a real prince, but you are a jerk.



    *** And Elizabeth lived happily ever after! ***

This is the day you've always dreamed of. You are finally marrying the love of
your life, prince Roland.


Castle Garden
You are standing in the garden behind your family's castle. On this lovely fall
evening, it is doing double duty as a wedding chapel.

Your betrothed, Roland, stands before you.

You can also see Father Alfred here.

>heteronor off
Ok!

>xyzzy
POOF! Your fairy godmother appears. She smiles at you and places a a necklace
around your neck.

Father Alfred begins the ceremony, "We are gathered here today to witness the
joining of two hearts." Rolande smiles shyly at you.

>* a a necklace
Noted.

>sing
There will be plenty of time to sing later.

"If anyone has a reason why these two should not be wed, speak now or forever
hold your peace." You hold your breath for a second, wondering whether anyone
will speak up. Fortunately, nobody does and you relax.

>x rolande
Rolande is the most attractive woman you have ever laid eyes on.

"Who gives this woman--" You glare icily at the minister. You are nobody's
property. "Ahem. Moving on," says the minister, visibly flustered. Rolande looks
at you questioningly, but says nothing.

>i
You are carrying a bouquet.

"Love is a wonderful thing." And so on. You're too excited to pay attention to
every word.

>i
You are carrying a bouquet.

"Elizabeth, do you take Rolande to be your wife?"

>yes
Of course you do!

The minister smiles at you and turns to Rolande. "And, Rolande, do you take
Elizabeth to be your wife?"

Rolande grins at you and exclaims, "I do!".

"I now pronounce you woman and... dragon?!?" The minister's eyes go wide,
seconds before he is incinerated by a burst of flame.

A large dragon flies overhead. The wedding guests scatter in every direction.
You cower against Rolande, but she pushes you towards the dragon and runs
towards the road.

The dragon eats all the guests it can catch, and when it has had its fill, it
smashes your castle to smithereens with its heavy tail and sets the remains on
fire. You are nearly caught in a blaze of flame as you duck behind what used to
be the stone wall of the garden. You are unhurt, but your fine gown snags on a
rose bush and tears.

As the dragon finally turns to go, it catches sight of Rolande, running down the
road towards the river. It swoops down and smashes the bridge just as Rolande is
about to cross it and catches she up in its claws. The dragon flies away with
your beloved princess.

The Paper Bag Princess
An interactive fairy tale by Adri
Release 1 / Serial number 130928 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) SD

Castle Ruins
This used to be your home. Now it is nothing more than a smoking pile of rubble.
The smoke obscures your view of the stars, and the primary source of light is
the burning remains of your furniture.

The only road away from the castle now ends abruptly at the river bank. The
forest surrounds you thickly on all sides, except for an area to the north where
the trees have been broken and scorched.

>take stars
They're hardly portable.

>x bank
You can't see any such thing.

>x river
The water is very deep here, and it moves quickly. Your father used to scare you
with stories of sharks, although you have never actually seen one.

>x forest
The forest surrounds you thickly on all sides, except for an area to the north
where the trees have been broken and scorched.

>i
You are carrying nothing.

>x me
You are young and beautiful, too lovely to be described in mere words. You are,
however, in dire need of a bath and a change of clothes.

You are stark naked, save for a handful of rags, a necklace, and a tarnished
gold crown.

>x necklace
A heart-shaped pendant on a gold chain.

>x rags
The tattered remains of your wedding gown.

>x crown
Your gold crown. It's looking a little worse for the wear.

>search rubble
You dig through the piles of rubble until you find a paper bag.

>x bag
It's a gift bag made out of paper. It looks like it used to have polka dots on
it, but now it's just scorched.

>wear it
Taken.

You quickly fashion a dress out of the gift bag. It's not as fancy as you're
used to, but it'll get the job done.

You strip off the remains of your wedding gown and discard them in a pile of
rubble.

You slip the makeshift dress over your head and pull it down past your hips.

>n

Burnt Forest
There's a trail of burned trees and what appear to be teeth leading to the
northeast. One tree in particular catches your eye.

>x tree
You examine the tree more closely. Someone has carved "PLUGH" into the trunk.

>plugh
The necklace suddenly begins to glow.

>x trees
The trail disappears into the woods.

You find a large branch lying on the trail.

>take branch
Taken.

>x teeth
Yes. Those are definitely teeth.

>touch teeth
You feel nothing unexpected.

The trail disappears into the woods.

Outside the Dragon's Cave
You are standing before a large cave. The entrance has been blocked by a large
wooden door.

>s
You came to rescue Rolande, and you are not leaving without her!

>knock on door
You grab the knocker and bang on the door.

The door opens and the dragon sticks his nose through the opening. He says,
"Well, a princess! I love to eat princesses, but I have already eaten a whole
castle today. I am a very tired dragon. Come back tomorrow." 

Then he slams the door in your face.

>knock on door
You bang on the door again.

The dragon sticks his nose out the door and says, "I am sure you are very
delicious, but I am rather tired and stuffed. Please do come back tomorrow."

This time he pauses a moment before slamming the door.

>knock on door
You already have the dragon's attention.

>save
Ok.

>ask dragon about fire
"Wait!" you exclaim.

The dragon rolls his eyes and steps entirely out of the cave, nudging the door
shut with his tail.

>ask dragon about fire
"Is it true," you say, "that you can burn up ten forests with your fiery
breath?"

"Oh, yes", says the dragon, and he takes a huge, deep breath and breathes out so
much fire that he burns up fifty forests.


Were you impressed by that display?


Apparently it takes a lot to impress you! But you force yourself to look
delighted as you shout, "Do it again!"

The dragon takes another huge breath and breathes out so much fire that he burns
up one hundred forests.


Wasn't that amazing?


Apparently it takes a lot to impress you! But you force yourself to look
delighted as you shout, "Do it again!"

The dragon takes another huge breath. But this time, nothing comes out.


>ask dragon about flight
You say, "Dragon, is it true that you can fly around the world in just ten
seconds?"

"Why, yes," says the dragon, and he jumps up and flies around the world in just
ten seconds. He seems very tired when he returns.

The dragon is so tired that he falls fast asleep.

The dragon is finally asleep. You should rescue Rolande and leave, before it
wakes up.

You are carrying a branch.

You step over the dragon and open the door to the cave.
