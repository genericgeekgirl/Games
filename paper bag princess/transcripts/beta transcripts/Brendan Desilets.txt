Princess Elizabeth is marrying the love of her life when a dragon attacks the
castle and kidnaps her partner.

The Paper Bag Princess was loosely based on the book of the same name by Robert
Munsch. Permission to write the game was requested from and granted by Mister
Munsch himself.

The cover art of Elizabeth was graciously provided by Stacey, aka "iduck" on
deviantART.

Beta testers--that's you!--will be listed here.

The > sign is where the game says, "Okay, what do you want to do now?"  You may
respond by typing an instruction -- usually an imperative verb, possibly
followed by prepositions and objects.  So, for instance, LOOK, LOOK AT FISH,
TAKE FISH.

Most of the actions you can perform in the world of IF are brief and specific.
>WALK WEST or >OPEN DOOR are likely to be provided. >TAKE A JOURNEY or >BUILD A
TABLE are not. Things like >GO TO THE HOTEL are on the borderline: some games
allow them, but most do not. In general, abstract, multi-stage behavior usually
has to be broken down in order for the game to understand it.

Other characters in IF games are sometimes rather limited. On the other hand,
there are also games in which character interaction is the main point of the
game. You should be able to get a feel early on for the characters -- if they
seem to respond to a lot of questions, remember what they're told, move around
on their own, etc., then they may be fairly important. If they have a lot of
stock responses and don't seem to have been the game designer's main concern,
then they are most likely present either as local color or to provide the
solution to a specific puzzle or set of puzzles. Characters in very puzzle-
oriented games often have to be bribed, threatened, or cajoled into doing
something that the player cannot do -- giving up a piece of information or an
object, reaching something high, allowing the player into a restricted area, and
so on.

Castle Garden
You are standing in the garden behind your family's castle. On this lovely fall
evening, it is doing double duty as a wedding chapel.

Your betrothed, Roland, stands before you.

You can also see Father Alfred here.

>heteronormativity on
Ok!

>**Where does the player find out about this option?
That's not a verb I recognize.

>x roland
Roland is the most attractive man you have ever laid eyes on.

Father Alfred begins the ceremony, "We are gathered here today to witness the
joining of two hearts." Roland smiles shyly at you.

>heteronormativity off
Ok!

>x roland
Rolande is the most attractive woman you have ever laid eyes on.

"If anyone has a reason why these two should not be wed, speak now or forever
hold your peace." You hold your breath for a second, wondering whether anyone
will speak up. Fortunately, nobody does and you relax.

>x me
You are young and beautiful, too lovely to be described in mere words.

You are wearing a wedding gown and a sparkly gold crown.

"Who gives this woman--" You glare icily at the minister. You are nobody's
property. "Ahem. Moving on," says the minister, visibly flustered. Rolande looks
at you questioningly, but says nothing.

>hit rolande
You would never attack Rolande! Except possibly with kisses.

"Love is a wonderful thing." And so on. You're too excited to pay attention to
every word.

>x priest
Father Alfred has been your family's minister for as long as you can remember.

"Elizabeth, do you take Rolande to be your wife?"

>yes
Of course you do!

The minister smiles at you and turns to Rolande. "And, Rolande, do you take
Elizabeth to be your wife?"

Rolande grins at you and exclaims, "I do!".

**This sentence shouldn't have a period after the quotation marks.

"I now pronounce you woman and... dragon?!?" The minister's eyes go wide,
seconds before he is incinerated by a burst of flame.

A large dragon flies overhead. The wedding guests scatter in every direction.
You cower against Rolande, but she pushes you towards the dragon and runs
towards the road.

The dragon eats all the guests it can catch, and when it has had its fill, it
smashes your castle to smithereens with its heavy tail and sets the remains on
fire. You are nearly caught in a blaze of flame as you duck behind what used to
be the stone wall of the garden. You are unhurt, but your fine gown snags on a
rose bush and tears.

As the dragon finally turns to go, it catches sight of Rolande, running down the
road towards the river. It swoops down and smashes the bridge just as Rolande is
about to cross it and catches she up in its claws. The dragon flies away with
your beloved princess.

**You'll have to change "catches she up..."

Castle Ruins
This used to be your home. Now it is nothing more than a smoking pile of rubble.
The smoke obscures your view of the stars, and the primary source of light is
the burning remains of your furniture.

The only road away from the castle now ends abruptly at the river bank. The
forest surrounds you thickly on all sides, except for an area to the north where
the trees have been broken and scorched.

>i
You are carrying nothing.

>x me
You are young and beautiful, too lovely to be described in mere words. You are,
however, in dire need of a bath and a change of clothes.

You are stark naked, save for a handful of rags and a tarnished gold crown.

>x rubble
These piles of brick and wood used to be your home.

>search it
You dig through the piles of rubble until you find a paper bag.

>take bag
Taken.

>make dress
I didn't understand that sentence.

>**Perhaps worth implementing.
That's not a verb I recognize.

>wear dress
You can't wear those!

>wear bag
You quickly fashion a dress out of the gift bag. It's not as fancy as you're
used to, but it'll get the job done.

You strip off the remains of your wedding gown.

You slip the makeshift dress over your head and pull it down past your hips.

>i
You are carrying a handful of rags.

>n

Burnt Forest
There's a trail of burned trees and what appear to be teeth leading to the
northeast. One tree in particular catches your eye.

>x tree
You examine the tree more closely. Someone has carved "PLUGH" into the trunk.

>plugh
POOF! Your fairy godmother appears. "Tsk," she says. "Poor girl. I'm not sure I
can help you with this one." She pauses and rummages around in her pockets,
pulling out a vial. She hands it to you. "This is the best I can do. Use it
wisely." Then she vanishes, as quickly as she appeared.

>x vial
 It's a vial of thick, black liquid.

>open it
You open the vial, revealing an oily black liquid.

>x trees
The trail disappears into the woods.

You find a large branch lying on the trail.

>take branch
Taken.

>put rags on branch
You fashion a torch from the branch and the remains of your wedding gown.

>pour oil on rags
You can't see any such thing.

>pour oil on torch
You pour the oily black liquid onto the torch.

>**You may want to allow pouring the oil on the rags.

Outside the Dragon's Cave
You are standing before a large cave. The entrance has been blocked by a large
wooden door.

>x door
The large door almost perfectly fills in the natural opening in the rock. There
is a golden knocker in the shape of a dragon's tail about a foot above your
head.

>knock on door
You grab the knocker and bang on the door.

The door opens and the dragon sticks his nose through the opening. He says,
"Well, a princess! I love to eat princesses, but I have already eaten a whole
castle today. I am a very tired dragon. Come back tomorrow." 

Then he slams the door in your face.

>g
You bang on the door again.

The dragon sticks his nose out the door and says, "I am sure you are very
delicious, but I am rather tired and stuffed. Please do come back tomorrow."

This time he pauses a moment before slamming the door.

>g
You already have the dragon's attention.

>yell
"Wait!" you exclaim.

The dragon rolls his eyes and steps entirely out of the cave, nudging the door
shut with his tail.

>ask dragon about herself
The dragon says, "I'm afraid I don't know anything about that."

>ask dragon about himself
You say, "Is it true that you are the smartest and fiercest dragon in the whole
world?"

"Yes", says the dragon. Boastful fellow, isn't he?

>ask dragon about fire
"Is it true," you say, "that you can burn up ten forests with your fiery
breath?"

"Oh, yes", says the dragon, and he takes a huge, deep breath and breathes out so
much fire that he burns up fifty forests.


Wasn't that amazing?


"Fantastic!" you exclaim. "Do it again!"

The dragon takes another huge breath and breathes out so much fire that he burns
up one hundred forests.


Were you impressed by that display?


"Magnificent!" you shout. "Do it again!"

The dragon takes another huge breath. But this time, nothing comes out.


>ask dragon about wings
The dragon says, "I'm afraid I don't know anything about that."

>**Perhaps the dragon should offer a hinting response here.
That's not a verb I recognize.

>ask dragon about flying
You say, "Dragon, is it true that you can fly around the world in just ten
seconds?"

"Why, yes," says the dragon, and he jumps up and flies around the world in just
ten seconds. He seems very tired when he returns.


Wasn't that amazing?


"Fantastic!" you exclaim. "Do it again!"

The dragon jumps up and flies around the whole world in just twenty seconds.
When he returns, he flops down on the ground.


The dragon is so tired that he falls fast asleep.

>e
(first opening the cave door)
You step over the dragon and open the door to the cave.

The Dragon's Cave
This is where the dragon lives. Piles of treasure fill the room, reflecting
light in every direction.

Your betrothed, Rolande, stands before you.

Rolande looks at you and says, "Elizabeth, you are a mess! You smell like ashes,
your hair is all tangled, and you are wearing a dirty paper bag. Come back when
you are dressed like a real princess."

>insult rolande
That's not a verb I recognize.

>reject rolande
That's not a verb I recognize.

>push rolande
That would be less than courteous.

>hit rolande
You slap Rolande! "Rolande," you say, "your clothes are really pretty, and your
hair is very neat. You look like a real princess, but you are a jerk.



    *** And Elizabeth lived happily ever after! ***

Outside the Dragon's Cave
You are standing before a large cave. The entrance has been blocked by a large
wooden door.

>open door
The door is locked. Perhaps you should try knocking.

>knock on door
You grab the knocker and bang on the door.

The door opens and the dragon sticks his nose through the opening. He says,
"Well, a princess! I love to eat princesses, but I have already eaten a whole
castle today. I am a very tired dragon. Come back tomorrow." 

Then he slams the door in your face.

>open door
The door is locked. Perhaps you should try knocking.

>knock on door
You bang on the door again.

The dragon sticks his nose out the door and says, "I am sure you are very
delicious, but I am rather tired and stuffed. Please do come back tomorrow."

This time he pauses a moment before slamming the door.

>open door
The door is locked. Perhaps you should try knocking.

>e
(first opening the cave door)
The door is locked. Perhaps you should try knocking.

>yell
"Wait!" you exclaim.

The dragon rolls his eyes and steps entirely out of the cave, nudging the door
shut with his tail.

>e
(first opening the cave door)

**I'm not sure that there's text explaining how the door becomes unlocked when the dragon falls asleep.
That's not a verb I recognize.

>ask dragon about soaring
The dragon says, "I'm afraid I don't know anything about that."

>ask dragon about gliding
The dragon says, "I'm afraid I don't know anything about that."

>ask dragon about flight
You say, "Dragon, is it true that you can fly around the world in just ten
seconds?"

"Why, yes," says the dragon, and he jumps up and flies around the world in just
ten seconds. He seems very tired when he returns.


Wasn't that amazing?


"Fantastic!" you exclaim. "Do it again!"

The dragon jumps up and flies around the whole world in just twenty seconds.
When he returns, he flops down on the ground.


>ask dragon about breathing
The dragon says, "I'm afraid I don't know anything about that."

>**Perhaps worth implementing.
That's not a verb I recognize.

>ask about fire
"Is it true," you say, "that you can burn up ten forests with your fiery
breath?"

"Oh, yes", says the dragon, and he takes a huge, deep breath and breathes out so
much fire that he burns up fifty forests.


Were you impressed by that display?


"Magnificent!" you shout. "Do it again!"

The dragon takes another huge breath and breathes out so much fire that he burns
up one hundred forests.


Wasn't that amazing?


"Fantastic!" you exclaim. "Do it again!"

The dragon takes another huge breath. But this time, nothing comes out.


The dragon is so tired that he falls fast asleep.

>open door
You open the cave door.

The Dragon's Cave
This is where the dragon lives. Piles of treasure fill the room, reflecting
light in every direction.

Your betrothed, Roland, stands before you.

Roland looks at you and says, "Elizabeth, you are a mess! You smell like ashes,
your hair is all tangled, and you are wearing a dirty paper bag. Come back when
you are dressed like a real princess."

>ask roland about me
Roland glares at you.

>ask roland about dragon
Roland glares at you.

>ask roland about roland
Roland glares at you.

>w
"Roland," you say, "your clothes are really pretty, and your hair is very neat.
You look like a real prince, but you are a jerk.



    *** And Elizabeth lived happily ever after! ***



Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, QUIT, or UNDO the last command?

your life, prince Roland.


Castle Garden
You are standing in the garden behind your family's castle. On this lovely fall
evening, it is doing double duty as a wedding chapel.

Your betrothed, Roland, stands before you.

You can also see Father Alfred here.
