You are young and beautiful, too lovely to be described in mere words.

You are wearing a wedding gown and a sparkly gold crown.

"If anyone has a reason why these two should not be wed, speak now or forever
hold your peace." You hold your breath for a second, wondering whether anyone
will speak up. Fortunately, nobody does and you relax.

Rolande is the most attractive woman you have ever laid eyes on.

This is the day you've always dreamed of. You are finally marrying the love of
your life, prince Roland.


Castle Garden
You are standing in the garden behind your family's castle. On this lovely fall
evening, it is doing double duty as a wedding chapel.

Your betrothed, Roland, stands before you.

You can also see Father Alfred here.

Castle Garden
You are standing in the garden behind your family's castle. On this lovely fall
evening, it is doing double duty as a wedding chapel.

Your betrothed, Rolande, stands before you.

You can also see Father Alfred here.

"Love is a wonderful thing." And so on. You're too excited to pay attention to

>x alfred
Father Alfred has been your family's minister for as long as you can remember.

"Elizabeth, do you take Rolande to be your wife?"

>x garden
You can't see any such thing.

>yes
Of course you do!

The minister smiles at you and turns to Rolande. "And, Rolande, do you take
Elizabeth to be your wife?"

Rolande grins at you and exclaims, "I do!".

"I now pronounce you woman and... dragon?!?" The minister's eyes go wide,
seconds before he is incinerated by a burst of flame.

A large dragon flies overhead. The wedding guests scatter in every direction.
You cower against Rolande, but she pushes you towards the dragon and runs
towards the road.

The dragon eats all the guests it can catch, and when it has had its fill, it
smashes your castle to smithereens with its heavy tail and sets the remains on
fire. You are nearly caught in a blaze of flame as you duck behind what used to
be the stone wall of the garden. You are unhurt, but your fine gown snags on a
rose bush and tears.

As the dragon finally turns to go, it catches sight of Rolande, running down the
road towards the river. It swoops down and smashes the bridge just as Rolande is
about to cross it and catches she up in its claws. The dragon flies away with
your beloved princess.

Castle Ruins
This used to be your home. Now it is nothing more than a smoking pile of rubble.
The smoke obscures your view of the stars, and the primary source of light is
the burning remains of your furniture.

The only road away from the castle now ends abruptly at the river bank. The
forest surrounds you thickly on all sides, except for an area to the north where
the trees have been broken and scorched.

>x furniture
You think you can make out the leg of a chair somewhere in that mess. It's
mostly just a blaze of fire.

>search furniture
You find nothing of interest.

>s
The only possible path appears to be through the forest to the north.

>n
Perhaps you should find something to wear first!

>i
You are carrying nothing.

>x rubble
These piles of brick and wood used to be your home.

>x river
The water is very deep here, and it moves quickly. Your father used to scare you
with stories of sharks, although you have never actually seen one.

>search rubble
You dig through the piles of rubble until you find a paper bag.

>search river
You find nothing of interest.

>get bag
Taken.

>wear bag
You quickly fashion a dress out of the gift bag. It's not as fancy as you're
used to, but it'll get the job done.

You strip off the remains of your wedding gown.

You slip the makeshift dress over your head and pull it down past your hips.

>x bag
It's a gift bag made out of paper. It looks like it used to have polka dots on
it, but now it's just scorched. It has been fashioned into a crude dress.

Burnt Forest
There's a trail of burned trees and what appear to be teeth leading to the
northeast. One tree in particular catches your eye.

>x tree
You examine the tree more closely. Someone has carved "PLUGH" into the trunk.

>plugh
POOF! Your fairy godmother appears. "Tsk," she says. "Poor girl. I'm not sure I
can help you with this one." She pauses and rummages around in her pockets,
pulling out a vial. She hands it to you. "This is the best I can do. Use it
wisely." Then she vanishes, as quickly as she appeared.

>x vial
 It's a vial of thick, black liquid.

>xyzzy
You hear a faint sound in the distance. Help does not arrive.

>ne
The woods seem pretty dark. Maybe you should find a light source.

>i
You are carrying a vial (closed) and a handful of rags.

You open the vial, revealing an oily black liquid.

You are standing before a large cave. The entrance has been blocked by a large

You can see a dragon here.

>ask dragon about fire
"Is it true," you say, "that you can burn up ten forests with your fiery
breath?"

"Oh, yes", says the dragon, and he takes a huge, deep breath and breathes out so
much fire that he burns up fifty forests.


Were you impressed by that display?


Apparently it takes a lot to impress you! But you force yourself to look
delighted as you shout, "Do it again!"

The dragon takes another huge breath and breathes out so much fire that he burns
up one hundred forests.


Wasn't that amazing?


Apparently it takes a lot to impress you! But you force yourself to look

The dragon takes another huge breath. But this time, nothing comes out.

You say, "Is it true that you are the smartest and fiercest dragon in the whole
world?"

"Yes", says the dragon. Boastful fellow, isn't he?

You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>ask dragon about flying
You say, "Dragon, is it true that you can fly around the world in just ten
seconds?"

"Why, yes," says the dragon, and he jumps up and flies around the world in just
ten seconds. He seems very tired when he returns.


Were you impressed by that display?


Apparently it takes a lot to impress you! But you force yourself to look
delighted as you shout, "Do it again!"

The dragon jumps up and flies around the whole world in just twenty seconds.
When he returns, he flops down on the ground.


The dragon is so tired that he falls fast asleep.

>xyzzy
POOF! Your fairy godmother appears. She smiles at you and places a a necklace
around your neck.

Father Alfred begins the ceremony, "We are gathered here today to witness the
joining of two hearts." Roland smiles shyly at you.

>x necklace
A heart-shaped pendant on a gold chain.

"If anyone has a reason why these two should not be wed, speak now or forever
hold your peace." You hold your breath for a second, wondering whether anyone
will speak up. Fortunately, nobody does and you relax.

>kiss roland
You'll have your chance soon enough!

"Who gives this woman--" You glare icily at the minister. You are nobody's
property. "Ahem. Moving on," says the minister, visibly flustered. Roland looks
at you questioningly, but says nothing.

>marry roland
Yes, Elizabeth. That's why you're here.

"Love is a wonderful thing." And so on. You're too excited to pay attention to
every word.

>marry father
You can't see any such thing.

>heteronormativty off
Ok!

>x father

>x priest
Father Alfred has been your family's minister for as long as you can remember.

"Elizabeth, do you take Rolande to be your wife?"

>* no father?
Noted.

>no
You shake your head. "No. I don't."

Oh.

There's a pause, and then the guests begin to murmur. The minister frowns.
"Elizabeth, are you sure?" he asks. Rolande just stares at you in shock. You
whisper, "I'm so sorry," and run off.



    *** And they didn't get married after all! ***

>yes
Of course you do!

The minister smiles at you and turns to Rolande. "And, Rolande, do you take
Elizabeth to be your wife?"

Rolande grins at you and exclaims, "I do!".

"I now pronounce you woman and... dragon?!?" The minister's eyes go wide,
seconds before he is incinerated by a burst of flame.

A large dragon flies overhead. The wedding guests scatter in every direction.
You cower against Rolande, but she pushes you towards the dragon and runs
towards the road.

The dragon eats all the guests it can catch, and when it has had its fill, it
smashes your castle to smithereens with its heavy tail and sets the remains on
fire. You are nearly caught in a blaze of flame as you duck behind what used to
be the stone wall of the garden. You are unhurt, but your fine gown snags on a
rose bush and tears.

As the dragon finally turns to go, it catches sight of Rolande, running down the
road towards the river. It swoops down and smashes the bridge just as Rolande is
about to cross it and catches she up in its claws. The dragon flies away with
your beloved princess.

Castle Ruins
This used to be your home. Now it is nothing more than a smoking pile of rubble.
The smoke obscures your view of the stars, and the primary source of light is
the burning remains of your furniture.

The only road away from the castle now ends abruptly at the river bank. The
forest surrounds you thickly on all sides, except for an area to the north where
the trees have been broken and scorched.

>i
You are carrying nothing.

>n
Perhaps you should find something to wear first!

>i

>x rubble
These piles of brick and wood used to be your home.

>search rubble
You dig through the piles of rubble until you find a paper bag.

>wear ba
You can't see any such thing.

>wear bag
Taken.

You quickly fashion a dress out of the gift bag. It's not as fancy as you're
used to, but it'll get the job done.

You strip off the remains of your wedding gown and discard them in a pile of
rubble.

You slip the makeshift dress over your head and pull it down past your hips.

Burnt Forest
There's a trail of burned trees and what appear to be teeth leading to the
northeast. One tree in particular catches your eye.

You examine the tree more closely. Someone has carved "PLUGH" into the trunk.

Outside the Dragon's Cave
You are standing before a large cave. The entrance has been blocked by a large
wooden door.

>x door
The large door almost perfectly fills in the natural opening in the rock. There
is a golden knocker in the shape of a dragon's tail about a foot above your
head.

>knock on door
You grab the knocker and bang on the door.

The door opens and the dragon sticks his nose through the opening. He says,
"Well, a princess! I love to eat princesses, but I have already eaten a whole
castle today. I am a very tired dragon. Come back tomorrow." 

Then he slams the door in your face.

>knock on door
You bang on the door again.

The dragon sticks his nose out the door and says, "I am sure you are very
delicious, but I am rather tired and stuffed. Please do come back tomorrow."

This time he pauses a moment before slamming the door.

>knock on door
You already have the dragon's attention.

>ask dragon about dragon
"Wait!" you exclaim.

The dragon rolls his eyes and steps entirely out of the cave, nudging the door
shut with his tail.

>ask dragon about dragon
You say, "Is it true that you are the smartest and fiercest dragon in the whole
world?"

"Yes", says the dragon. Boastful fellow, isn't he?

>* hmm, worked this time?
Noted.

>
* ok, I guess looking back I didn't try asking the dragon about himself earlier. weird
Noted.

>ask dragon about thinking
The dragon says, "I'm afraid I don't know anything about that."

>ask dragon about flying
You say, "Dragon, is it true that you can fly around the world in just ten
seconds?"

"Why, yes," says the dragon, and he jumps up and flies around the world in just
ten seconds. He seems very tired when he returns.


Were you impressed by that display?


"Fantastic!" you exclaim. "Do it again!"

The dragon jumps up and flies around the whole world in just twenty seconds.

>ask dragon about fire
"Is it true," you say, "that you can burn up ten forests with your fiery
breath?"

"Oh, yes", says the dragon, and he takes a huge, deep breath and breathes out so
much fire that he burns up fifty forests.


Wasn't that amazing?


"Magnificent!" you shout. "Do it again!"

The dragon takes another huge breath and breathes out so much fire that he burns
up one hundred forests.


Were you impressed by that display?


"Fantastic!" you exclaim. "Do it again!"

The dragon takes another huge breath. But this time, nothing comes out.


The dragon is so tired that he falls fast asleep.
