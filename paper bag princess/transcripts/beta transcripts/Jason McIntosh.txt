>x me
You are young and beautiful, too lovely to be described in mere words.

You are wearing a wedding gown and a sparkly gold crown.

Father Alfred begins the ceremony, "We are gathered here today to witness the joining of two hearts." Roland smiles shyly at you.

>kiss roland
You'll have your chance soon enough!

"If anyone has a reason why these two should not be wed, speak now or forever hold your peace." You hold your breath for a second, wondering whether anyone will speak up. Fortunately, nobody does and you relax.

>x roland
Roland is the most attractive man you have ever laid eyes on.

"Who gives this woman--" You glare icily at the minister. You are nobody's property. "Ahem. Moving on," says the minister, visibly flustered. Roland looks at you questioningly, but says nothing.

>glare
That's not a verb I recognize.

>x minister
Father Alfred has been your family's minister for as long as you can remember.

"Love is a wonderful thing." And so on. You're too excited to pay attention to every word.

>swoon
That's not a verb I recognize.

>* aww
Noted.

>marry roland
Yes, Elizabeth. That's why you're here.

"Elizabeth, do you take Roland to be your husband?"

>* yay
Noted.

>yes
Of course you do!

The minister smiles at you and turns to Roland. "And, Roland, do you take Elizabeth to be your wife?"

Roland grins at you and exclaims, "I do!"

"I now pronounce you man and... dragon?!?" The minister's eyes go wide, seconds before he is incinerated by a burst of flame.

A large dragon flies overhead. The wedding guests scatter in every direction. You cower against Roland, but he pushes you towards the dragon and runs towards the road.

The dragon eats all the guests it can catch, and when it has had its fill, it smashes your castle to smithereens with its heavy tail and sets the remains on fire. You are nearly caught in a blaze of flame as you duck behind what used to be the stone wall of the garden. You are unhurt, but your fine gown snags on a rose bush and tears.

As the dragon finally turns to go, it catches sight of Roland, running down the road towards the river. It swoops down and smashes the bridge just as Roland is about to cross it and catches him up in its claws. The dragon flies away with your beloved prince.

Castle Ruins
This used to be your home. Now it is nothing more than a smoking pile of rubble. The smoke obscures your view of the stars, and the primary source of light is the burning remains of your furniture.

The only road away from the castle now ends abruptly at the river bank. The forest surrounds you thickly on all sides, except for an area to the north where the trees have been broken and scorched.

>oh noes
That's not a verb I recognize.

>n
Perhaps you should find something to wear first.

>i
You are carrying nothing.

>x me
You are young and beautiful, too lovely to be described in mere words. You are, however, in dire need of a bath and a change of clothes.

You are stark naked, save for a handful of rags and a tarnished gold crown.

>* heh, did my clothes burn off? I can't remember? Maybe include a reminder of why we're naked here
Noted.

>x smoke
You can barely see anything through the smoke.

>x river
The water is very deep here, and it moves quickly. Your father used to scare you with stories of sharks, although you have never actually seen one.

>bathe
That's not a verb I recognize.

>* aww, but we need a bath
Noted.

>swim
You are a powerful swimmer, but you would freeze to death before you could reach the other side.

>x bridge
This well-traveled road used to connect the castle to the rest of the kingdom. Unfortunately, the bridge across the river has been rendered impassable.

>x castle
These piles of stones and wood used to be your home. You catch a glimpse of something colorful hidden in one of the piles.

>x something
You can't quite make it out from here. Why don't you try digging through the rubble?

>dig
(in the rubble)
You dig through the piles of rubble until you find a paper bag.

>get bag
You take the paper bag.

>x bag
It's a gift bag made out of paper. It looks like it used to have polka dots on it, but now it's just scorched.

>look in bag
You find nothing of interest.

>don bag
You quickly fashion a dress out of the gift bag. It's not as fancy as you're used to, but it'll get the job done.

You strip off the remains of your wedding gown.

You slip the makeshift dress over your head and pull it down past your hips.

>* x crown
Noted.

>* oops, ignore previous
Noted.

>x crown
Your gold crown. It's looking a little worse for the wear.

>doff crown
You should leave that on. A princess should never be without her crown.

>x gown
You can't see any such thing.

>x bag
It's a gift bag made out of paper. It looks like it used to have polka dots on it, but now it's just scorched. It has been fashioned into a crude dress.

>* 'gown' should refer to rags
Noted.

>x rags
The tattered remains of your wedding gown.

Burnt Forest
There's a trail of burned trees and what appear to be teeth leading to the northeast. One tree in particular catches your eye.

>x teeth
Yes. Those are definitely teeth.

>get teeth
You have absolutely no need for those. What are you going to do, make a necklace?

>* What kind of teeth? Like giant dragon teeth or a ton of gross human teeth?
Noted.

>x tree
You examine the tree more closely. Someone has carved "PLUGH" into the trunk.

There is a large branch propped up against the base of the tree.

>get branch
You take the branch.

>plugh
POOF! Your fairy godmother appears. "Tsk," she says. "Poor girl. I'm not sure I can help you with this one." She pauses and rummages around in her pockets, pulling out a vial. She hands it to you. "This is the best I can do. Use it wisely." Then she vanishes, as quickly as she appeared.

>x vial
In the vial is an oily black liquid.

I didn't understand that sentence.

What do you want to tie the handful of rags to?

Outside the Dragon's Cave
You are standing before a large cave. The entrance has been blocked by a large wooden door.

>* hm, wonder how that worked?
Noted.

>open door
The door is locked. Perhaps you should try knocking.

>x door
The large door almost perfectly fills in the natural opening in the rock. There is a golden knocker in the shape of a dragon's tail about a foot above your head.

>Noted.

>knock
(the cave door)
You grab the knocker and bang on the door.

The door opens and the dragon sticks his nose through the opening. He says, "Well, a princess! I love to eat princesses, but I have already eaten a whole castle today. I am a very tired dragon. Come back tomorrow." 

Then he slams the door in your face.

>well i never
That's not a verb I recognize.

>knock
(the cave door)
You bang on the door again.

The dragon sticks his nose out the door and says, "I am sure you are very delicious, but I am rather tired and stuffed. Please do come back tomorrow."

This time he pauses a moment before slamming the door.

>open door
The door is locked. Perhaps you should try knocking.

>knock
(the cave door)
You already have the dragon's attention.

>x dragon
Up close, you realize this dragon isn't actually very large, only about fifteen cubits from the tip of its nose to the spiked end of its tail. Its green scales shimmer in the glow of your torch.

>* Uh oh, I was told that the dragon slammed the door, but here he is?
I only understood you as far as wanting to take inventory.

>pet dragon
That's not a verb I recognize.

>dragon, hi
"Wait!" you exclaim.

Surprised, the dragon steps entirely out of the cave, nudging the door shut with his tail.

You say, "Is it true that you are the smartest and fiercest dragon in the whole world?"

"Yes," says the dragon. Boastful fellow, isn't he?

>Noted.

>dragon, you are the best dragon
The dragon says, "I'm afraid I don't know anything about that."

>ask dragon about prince
The dragon says, "Oh, yes. I love to eat royals. But I have already eaten a whole castle today, so I am saving your prince for later."

>ask dragon about dragon
You say, "Is it true that you are the smartest and fiercest dragon in the whole world?"

"Yes," says the dragon. Boastful fellow, isn't he?

>yes
That was a rhetorical question.

>ask dragon about me
The dragon says, "I love to eat princesses, but I have already eaten a whole castle today. Come back tomorrow."

>ask dragon about fire
"Is it true," you say, "that you can burn up ten forests with your fiery breath?"

"Oh, yes," says the dragon, and he takes a huge, deep breath and breathes out so much fire that he burns up fifty forests.

Wasn't that amazing?

>yes
"Fantastic!" you exclaim. "Do it again!"

The dragon takes another huge breath and breathes out so much fire that he burns up one hundred forests.

Were you impressed by that display?

>yes
"Magnificent!" you shout. "Do it again!"

The dragon takes another huge breath. But this time, nothing comes out.

>ask dragon about fire
The dragon doesn't have enough fire left to cook a meatball!

>show torch to dragon
The dragon sniffs at you and says dryly, "I am not interested in that."

>* but it's fire!
Noted.

>give torch to dragon
The dragon sniffs at you and says dryly, "I am not interested in that."

>x dragon
Up close, you realize this dragon isn't actually very large, only about fifteen cubits from the tip of its nose to the spiked end of its tail. Its green scales shimmer in the glow of your torch.

>punch dragon
The dragon is much larger and stronger than you. Perhaps you can outwit it in some way.

>ask dragon about river
The dragon says, "I'm afraid I don't know anything about that."

>ask dragon about teeth
The dragon says, "I'm afraid I don't know anything about that."

>ask dragon about flying
You say, "Dragon, is it true that you can fly around the world in just ten seconds?"

"Why, yes," says the dragon, and he jumps up and flies around the world in just ten seconds. He seems very tired when he returns.

Wasn't that amazing?

>yes
"Fantastic!" you exclaim. "Do it again!"

The dragon jumps up and flies around the whole world in just twenty seconds. When he returns, he flops down on the ground.

The dragon is so tired that he falls fast asleep.

>es
That's not a verb I recognize.

>pet dragon
That's not a verb I recognize.

>* dammit

You must supply a noun.

>enter cave

The Dragon's Cave
This is where the dragon lives. Piles of treasure fill the room, reflecting light in every direction.

Your betrothed, Roland, stands before you.

Roland looks at you and says, "Elizabeth, you are a mess! You smell like ashes, your hair is all tangled, and you are wearing a dirty paper bag. Come back when you are dressed like a real princess."

>roland, you suck
Roland glares at you.

>doff bag
You remove the gift bag, folding it carefully.

>throw bag at roland
You lack the nerve when it comes to the crucial moment.

>* aww
Noted.

>x roland
Roland is the most attractive man you have ever laid eyes on. Too bad he's also the biggest jerk you've ever met!

>slap roland
You slap Roland!

"Roland," you say, "your clothes are really pretty, and your hair is very neat. You look like a real prince, but you are also a real jerk.

You turn around and walk out the door.



    *** And Elizabeth lived happily ever after! ***
