>wait
You beam happily at Roland.

Father Alfred begins the ceremony, "We are gathered here today to witness the joining of two hearts." Roland smiles shyly at you.

>kick roland
That's not a verb I recognize.

>hit roland
You would never attack Roland! Except possibly with kisses.

"If anyone has a reason why these two should not be wed, speak now or forever hold your peace." You hold your breath for a second, wondering whether anyone will speak up. Fortunately, nobody does and you relax.

>attack roland with kisses
I only understood you as far as wanting to attack Roland.

>eat roland
(first taking Roland)
To be your lawfully wedded husband? Yes, Elizabeth. Be patient.

"Who gives this woman--" You glare icily at the minister. You are nobody's property. "Ahem. Moving on," says the minister, visibly flustered. Roland looks at you questioningly, but says nothing.

>give myself to roland
(first taking yourself)
You are always self-possessed.

"Love is a wonderful thing." And so on. You're too excited to pay attention to every word.

>plugh
POOF! Your fairy godmother appears. She smiles at you and places a necklace around your neck.

"Elizabeth, do you take Roland to be your husband?"

>x fairy godmother
You can't see any such thing.

>x godmother
You can't see any such thing.

>* where did she go?
Noted.

>x necklace
The minister is waiting for your answer. Please say "yes" or "no".

>yes
Of course you do!

The minister smiles at you and turns to Roland. "And, Roland, do you take Elizabeth to be your wife?"

Roland grins at you and exclaims, "I do!"

"I now pronounce you man and... dragon?!?" The minister's eyes go wide, seconds before he is incinerated by a burst of flame.

A large dragon flies overhead. The wedding guests scatter in every direction. You cower against Roland, but he pushes you towards the dragon and runs towards the road.

The dragon eats all the guests it can catch, and when it has had its fill, it smashes your castle to smithereens with its heavy tail and sets the remains on fire. You are nearly caught in a blaze of flame as you duck behind what used to be the stone wall of the garden. You are unhurt, but your fine gown snags on a rose bush and tears.

As the dragon finally turns to go, it catches sight of Roland, running down the road towards the river. It swoops down and smashes the bridge just as Roland is about to cross it and catches him up in its claws. The dragon flies away with your beloved prince.

Castle Ruins
This used to be your home. Now it is nothing more than a smoking pile of rubble. The smoke obscures your view of the stars, and the primary source of light is the burning remains of your furniture.

The only road away from the castle now ends abruptly at the river bank. The forest surrounds you thickly on all sides, except for an area to the north where the trees have been broken and scorched.

>plugh
The necklace suddenly begins to glow.

>search rubble
You dig through the piles of rubble until you find a paper bag.

>wear bag
You take the paper bag.

You quickly fashion a dress out of the gift bag. It's not as fancy as you're used to, but it'll get the job done.

You strip off the remains of your wedding gown and discard them in a pile of rubble.

You slip the makeshift dress over your head and pull it down past your hips.

>n

Burnt Forest
There's a trail of burned trees and what appear to be teeth leading to the northeast. One tree in particular catches your eye.

>x teeth
Yes. Those are definitely teeth.

>count teeth
That's not a verb I recognize.

>get teeth
You have absolutely no need for those. What are you going to do, make a necklace?

>ne

Outside the Dragon's Cave
You are standing before a large cave. The entrance has been blocked by a large wooden door.

>g
The door into the cave leads east. The only escape is back into the forest. You came to rescue Roland, and you are not leaving without him!

>knock
(the cave door)
You grab the knocker and bang on the door.

The door opens and the dragon sticks his nose through the opening. He says, "Well, a princess! I love to eat princesses, but I have already eaten a whole castle today. I am a very tired dragon. Come back tomorrow." 

Then he slams the door in your face.

>* The dragon was an "it" when it attacked the wedding, now it's a "he"
Noted.

>knock
(the cave door)
You bang on the door again.

The dragon sticks his nose out the door and says, "I am sure you are very delicious, but I am rather tired and stuffed. Please do come back tomorrow."

This time he pauses a moment before slamming the door.

>dragon, hello
"Wait!" you exclaim.

Surprised, the dragon steps entirely out of the cave, nudging the door shut with his tail.

You say, "Is it true that you are the smartest and fiercest dragon in the whole world?"

"Yes," says the dragon. Boastful fellow, isn't he?

>dragon, flying
The dragon says, "I'm afraid I don't know anything about that."

>ask dragon about flying
You say, "Dragon, is it true that you can fly around the world in just ten seconds?"

"Why, yes," says the dragon, and he jumps up and flies around the world in just ten seconds. He seems very tired when he returns.

Wasn't that amazing?

>yes
"Fantastic!" you exclaim. "Do it again!"

The dragon jumps up and flies around the whole world in just twenty seconds. When he returns, he flops down on the ground.

>e
The dragon is blocking the doorway and will not allow you to pass.

>open door
The door is locked. Perhaps you should try knocking.

>x dragon
Up close, you realize this dragon isn't actually very large, only about fifteen cubits from the tip of its nose to the spiked end of its tail. Its green scales shimmer in the glow of your necklace.

>* now it says "its"...
Noted.

>ask dragon about flame
"Is it true," you say, "that you can burn up ten forests with your fiery breath?"

"Oh, yes," says the dragon, and he takes a huge, deep breath and breathes out so much fire that he burns up fifty forests.

Were you impressed by that display?

>no
Apparently it takes a lot to impress you! But you force yourself to look delighted as you shout, "Do it again!"

The dragon takes another huge breath and breathes out so much fire that he burns up one hundred forests.

Wasn't that amazing?

>no
Apparently it takes a lot to impress you! But you force yourself to look delighted as you shout, "Do it again!"

The dragon takes another huge breath. But this time, nothing comes out.

The dragon is so tired that he falls fast asleep.

>open door
You open the cave door.

>* Wasn't it locked before?
Noted.

>knock
(the cave door)
The door is already open.

>close
What do you want to close?

>door
You close the cave door.

>knock
(the cave door)
You knock on the cave door, but there is no response.

>lock door
What do you want to lock the cave door with?

>key
You can't see any such thing.

>unlock door
What do you want to unlock the cave door with?

>crown
That's unlocked at the moment.

>in
The door into the cave leads east. The only escape is back into the forest. You came to rescue Roland, and you are not leaving without him!

>e
(first opening the cave door)

The Dragon's Cave
This is where the dragon lives. Piles of treasure fill the room, reflecting light in every direction.

Your betrothed, Roland, stands before you.

Roland looks at you and says, "Elizabeth, you are a mess! You smell like ashes, your hair is all tangled, and you are wearing a dirty paper bag. Come back when you are dressed like a real princess."

>x piles
You can't see any such thing.

>x treasure
There is more gold and precious gems here than you have ever seen before in your life.

>x gold
You can't see any such thing.

>x gems
You can't see any such thing.

>burn roland
You slap Roland!

"Roland," you say, "your clothes are really pretty, and your hair is very neat. You look like a real prince, but you are also a real jerk.

You turn around and walk out the door.



    *** And Elizabeth lived happily ever after! ***
