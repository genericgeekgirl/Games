>x roland
Roland is the most attractive man you have ever laid eyes on.

Father Alfred begins the ceremony, "We are gathered here today to witness the joining of two hearts." Roland smiles shyly at you.

>smile at roland
That's not a verb I recognize.

>smile
That's not a verb I recognize.

>x alfred
Father Alfred has been your family's minister for as long as you can remember.

"If anyone has a reason why these two should not be wed, speak now or forever hold your peace." You hold your breath for a second, wondering whether anyone will speak up. Fortunately, nobody does and you relax.

>x me
You are young and beautiful, too lovely to be described in mere words.

You are wearing a wedding gown and a sparkly gold crown.

"Who gives this woman--" You glare icily at the minister. You are nobody's property. "Ahem. Moving on," says the minister, visibly flustered. Roland looks at you questioningly, but says nothing.

>z
You beam happily at Roland.

"Love is a wonderful thing." And so on. You're too excited to pay attention to every word.

>z
You beam happily at Roland.

"Elizabeth, do you take Roland to be your husband?"

>yes
Of course you do!

The minister smiles at you and turns to Roland. "And, Roland, do you take Elizabeth to be your wife?"

Roland grins at you and exclaims, "I do!"

"I now pronounce you man and... dragon?!?" The minister's eyes go wide, seconds before he is incinerated by a burst of flame.

A large dragon flies overhead. The wedding guests scatter in every direction. You cower against Roland, but he pushes you towards the dragon and runs towards the road.

The dragon eats all the guests it can catch, and when it has had its fill, it smashes your castle to smithereens with its heavy tail and sets the remains on fire. You are nearly caught in a blaze of flame as you duck behind what used to be the stone wall of the garden. You are unhurt, but your fine gown snags on a rose bush and tears.

As the dragon finally turns to go, it catches sight of Roland, running down the road towards the river. It swoops down and smashes the bridge just as Roland is about to cross it and catches him up in its claws. The dragon flies away with your beloved prince.

Castle Ruins
This used to be your home. Now it is nothing more than a smoking pile of rubble. The smoke obscures your view of the stars, and the primary source of light is the burning remains of your furniture.

The only road away from the castle now ends abruptly at the river bank. The forest surrounds you thickly on all sides, except for an area to the north where the trees have been broken and scorched.

>i\]
That's not a verb I recognize.

>i
You are carrying nothing.

>x rubble
These piles of stones and wood used to be your home. You catch a glimpse of something colorful hidden in one of the piles.

>x piles
You can't see any such thing.

>x colorful
You can't quite make it out from here. Why don't you try digging through the rubble?

>dig rubble
I didn't understand that sentence.

>dig
(in the rubble)
You dig through the piles of rubble until you find a paper bag.

>x bag
It's a gift bag made out of paper. It looks like it used to have polka dots on it, but now it's just scorched.

>open bag
That's not something you can open.

>get bag
You take the paper bag.

>i
You are carrying a paper bag.

>l
Castle Ruins
This used to be your home. Now it is nothing more than a smoking pile of rubble. The smoke obscures your view of the stars, and the primary source of light is the burning remains of your furniture.

The only road away from the castle now ends abruptly at the river bank. The forest surrounds you thickly on all sides, except for an area to the north where the trees have been broken and scorched.

>x furniture
You think you can make out the leg of a chair somewhere in that mess. It's mostly just a blaze of fire.

>get leg
None of the furniture is worth saving.

>n
Perhaps you should find something to wear first.

>wear bag
You quickly fashion a dress out of the gift bag. It's not as fancy as you're used to, but it'll get the job done.

You strip off the remains of your wedding gown.

You slip the makeshift dress over your head and pull it down past your hips.

>n

Burnt Forest
There's a trail of burned trees and what appear to be teeth leading to the northeast. One tree in particular catches your eye.

>x tree
You examine the tree more closely. Someone has carved "PLUGH" into the trunk.

There is a large branch propped up against the base of the tree.

>get branch
You take the branch.

>i
You are carrying a branch and a handful of rags.

>x rags
The tattered remains of your wedding gown.

>plugh
POOF! Your fairy godmother appears. "Tsk," she says. "Poor girl. I'm not sure I can help you with this one." She pauses and rummages around in her pockets, pulling out a vial. She hands it to you. "This is the best I can do. Use it wisely." Then she vanishes, as quickly as she appeared.

>x vial
It's a vial, containing a dark liquid.

>i
You are carrying a vial (closed), a branch, and a handful of rags.

>n
The trees are impassable in that direction. The trail seems to be leading northeast.

>ne
The woods seem pretty dark. Maybe you should find a light source.

>put rags on branch
Try combining the handful of rags with the branch.

>combine rags and branch
You can't use multiple objects with that verb.

>combine rags with branch
You fashion a torch from the branch and the remains of your wedding gown.

>i
You are carrying a torch and a vial (closed).

>light torch
The torch needs something else.

>open vial
You open the vial, revealing an oily black liquid.

>dip torch in vial
That's not a verb I recognize.

>put torch in vial
You put the torch into the vial.

>i
You are carrying a vial.

>get torch
You take the torch.

>i
You are carrying a torch and a vial.

>x torch
It is a torch crafted from a branch and the remains of your wedding gown.

>light branch
The torch needs something else.

>pour vial on torch
You can't pour the vial.

Princess Elizabeth is about to marry the love of her life when a dragon attacks the castle and kidnaps her betrothed.

The Paper Bag Princess is loosely based upon the book of the same name by Robert Munsch. Permission to write the game was requested from and granted by Mister Munsch himself.

The cover art of Elizabeth was graciously provided by Stacey, aka "iduck" on deviantART.

Thank you so much to my beta testers: Brendan Desilets, Dan Shiovitz, Dan Kelly, Johnny Rivera, Matthew Miller and Z Goddard.

Outside the Dragon's Cave
You are standing before a large cave. The entrance has been blocked by a large wooden door.

>knock on door
You grab the knocker and bang on the door.

The door opens and the dragon sticks his nose through the opening. He says, "Well, a princess! I love to eat princesses, but I have already eaten a whole castle today. I am a very tired dragon. Come back tomorrow." 

Then he slams the door in your face.

>i
You are carrying a torch.

>x door
The large door almost perfectly fills in the natural opening in the rock. There is a golden knocker in the shape of a dragon's tail about a foot above your head.

>knock
(the cave door)
You bang on the door again.

The dragon sticks his nose out the door and says, "I am sure you are very delicious, but I am rather tired and stuffed. Please do come back tomorrow."

This time he pauses a moment before slamming the door.

>g
(the cave door)
You already have the dragon's attention.

>in
The door into the cave leads east. The only escape is back into the forest. You came to rescue Roland, and you are not leaving without him!

>e
The dragon is blocking the doorway and will not allow you to pass.

>talk to dragon
"Wait!" you exclaim.

Surprised, the dragon steps entirely out of the cave, nudging the door shut with his tail.

You say, "Is it true that you are the smartest and fiercest dragon in the whole world?"

"Yes", says the dragon. Boastful fellow, isn't he?

>* comma should be before the quotes, not after
Noted.

You say, "Is it true that you are the smartest and fiercest dragon in the whole world?"

Outside the Dragon's Cave
You are standing before a large cave. The entrance has been blocked by a large wooden door.

You can see a dragon here.

>x dragon
Up close, you realize this dragon isn't actually very large, only about fifteen cubits from the tip of its nose to the spiked end of its tail. Its green scales shimmer in the glow of your torch.

>x scales
You can't see any such thing.

>x tail
You can't see any such thing.

>pull tail
You can't see any such thing.

The dragon is much larger and stronger than you. Perhaps you can outwit it in some way.

You say, "Is it true that you are the smartest and fiercest dragon in the whole world?"

"Yes", says the dragon. Boastful fellow, isn't he?

The dragon says, "I'm afraid I don't know anything about that."

The dragon says, "I love to eat princesses, but I have already eaten a whole castle today. Come back tomorrow."

Outside the Dragon's Cave
You are standing before a large cave. The entrance has been blocked by a large wooden door.

You can see a dragon here.

>ask dragon about fire
"Is it true," you say, "that you can burn up ten forests with your fiery breath?"

"Oh, yes", says the dragon, and he takes a huge, deep breath and breathes out so much fire that he burns up fifty forests.

Wasn't that amazing?

>yes
"Fantastic!" you exclaim. "Do it again!"

The dragon takes another huge breath and breathes out so much fire that he burns up one hundred forests.

Were you impressed by that display?

>yes
"Magnificent!" you shout. "Do it again!"

The dragon takes another huge breath. But this time, nothing comes out.

>e

You can see a dragon here.

>ask dragon about flight
You say, "Dragon, is it true that you can fly around the world in just ten seconds?"

"Why, yes," says the dragon, and he jumps up and flies around the world in just ten seconds. He seems very tired when he returns.

Wasn't that amazing?

>yes
"Fantastic!" you exclaim. "Do it again!"

The dragon jumps up and flies around the whole world in just twenty seconds. When he returns, he flops down on the ground.
