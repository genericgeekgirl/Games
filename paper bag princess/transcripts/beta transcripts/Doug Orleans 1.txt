Castle Garden
You are standing in the garden behind your family's castle. On this lovely fall evening, it is doing double duty as a wedding chapel.

Your betrothed, Roland, stands before you.

You can also see Father Alfred here.

Father Alfred begins the ceremony, "We are gathered here today to witness the joining of two hearts." Roland smiles shyly at you.

>x me
You are young and beautiful, too lovely to be described in mere words.

You are wearing a wedding gown and a sparkly gold crown.

"If anyone has a reason why these two should not be wed, speak now or forever hold your peace." You hold your breath for a second, wondering whether anyone will speak up. Fortunately, nobody does and you relax.

>i
You are carrying a bouquet.

"Who gives this woman--" You glare icily at the minister. You are nobody's property. "Ahem. Moving on," says the minister, visibly flustered. Roland looks at you questioningly, but says nothing.

>x bouquet
Your bouquet contains a collection of purple and orange flowers, tied up with a white ribbon. You don't even know what most of those flowers are called.

"Love is a wonderful thing." And so on. You're too excited to pay attention to every word.

>untie bouquet
That's not a verb I recognize.

>x ribbon
It is a length of white satin ribbon, wrapped around the stems of the flowers to hold them together.

"Elizabeth, do you take Roland to be your husband?"

>get ribbon
The bow is tied much too tightly. Besides, if you removed the ribbon, the flowers would fall everywhere.

>throw bouquet
It is not time to throw the bouquet yet.

>drop purple flower
You can't see any such thing.

>smell bouquet
You hold the bouquet up to your face and breathe in deeply.

>x gown
The minister is waiting for your answer. Please say "yes" or "no".

>no
You shake your head. "No. I don't."

Oh.

There's a pause, and then the guests begin to murmur. The minister frowns. "Elizabeth, are you sure?" he asks. Roland just stares at you in shock. You whisper, "I'm so sorry," and run off.



    *** And they didn't get married after all! ***
