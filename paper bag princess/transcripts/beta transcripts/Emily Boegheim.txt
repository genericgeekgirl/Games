   How to Play
   Hints
   Walkthrough

Princess Elizabeth is about to marry the love of her life when a dragon attacks the castle and kidnaps her betrothed.

The Paper Bag Princess is loosely based upon the book of the same name by Robert Munsch. Permission to write the game was requested from and granted by Mister Munsch himself.

The cover art of Elizabeth was graciously provided by Stacey, aka "iduck" on deviantART.

Thank you so much to my beta testers: Brendan Desilets, Dan Shiovitz, Dan Kelly, Johnny Rivera, Matthew Miller, Scott Snyder and Z Goddard.

Castle Ruins
This used to be your home. Now it is nothing more than a smoking pile of rubble. The smoke obscures your view of the stars, and the primary source of light is the burning remains of your furniture.

The only road away from the castle now ends abruptly at the river bank. The forest surrounds you thickly on all sides, except for an area to the north where the trees have been broken and scorched.

>score
There is no score in this story.

>* would prefer not to have the turn count listed in the status line either, then
Noted.

>x rubble
These piles of stones and wood used to be your home. You catch a glimpse of something colorful hidden in one of the piles.

>x colorful
You can't quite make it out from here. Why don't you try digging through the rubble?

>search rubble
You dig through the piles of rubble until you find a paper bag.

>x paper bag
It's a gift bag made out of paper. It looks like it used to have polka dots on it, but now it's just scorched.

>x me
You are young and beautiful, too lovely to be described in mere words. You are, however, in dire need of a bath and a change of clothes.

You are stark naked, save for a handful of rags and a tarnished gold crown.

>x rags
The tattered remains of your wedding gown.

>x crown
Your gold crown. It's looking a little worse for the wear.

>wear bag
You take the paper bag.

You quickly fashion a dress out of the gift bag. It's not as fancy as you're used to, but it'll get the job done.

You strip off the remains of your wedding gown.

You slip the makeshift dress over your head and pull it down past your hips.

Castle Ruins
This used to be your home. Now it is nothing more than a smoking pile of rubble. The smoke obscures your view of the stars, and the primary source of light is the burning remains of your furniture.

The only road away from the castle now ends abruptly at the river bank. The forest surrounds you thickly on all sides, except for an area to the north where the trees have been broken and scorched.

>x river
The water is very deep here, and it moves quickly. Your father used to scare you with stories of sharks, although you have never actually seen one.

>x forest
The forest surrounds you thickly on all sides, except for an area to the north where the trees have been broken and scorched.

>x road
This well-traveled road used to connect the castle to the rest of the kingdom. Unfortunately, the bridge across the river has been rendered impassable.

>search rubble
You don't find anything else.

>x furniture
You think you can make out the leg of a chair somewhere in that mess. It's mostly just a blaze of fire.

>get leg
None of the furniture is worth saving.

>castle, goodbye
You can't talk to the rubble.

Burnt Forest
There's a trail of burned trees and what appear to be teeth leading to the northeast. One tree in particular catches your eye.

>x teeth
Yes. Those are definitely teeth.

>* ew
Noted.

>get teeth
You have absolutely no need for those. What are you going to do, make a necklace?

>* ...maybe?
Noted.

>make club out of chair leg and teeth
I didn't understand that sentence.

>x tree
You examine the tree more closely. Someone has carved "PLUGH" into the trunk.

There is a large branch propped up against the base of the tree.

>x branch
It's a large branch. It looks pretty sturdy.

>get branch
You take the branch.

>plugh
POOF! Your fairy godmother appears. "Tsk," she says. "Poor girl. I'm not sure I can help you with this one." She pauses and rummages around in her pockets, pulling out a vial. She hands it to you. "This is the best I can do. Use it wisely." Then she vanishes, as quickly as she appeared.

>xyzzy
You hear a faint sound in the distance. Help does not arrive.

>x teeth
A variety of teeth, only some of which appear to be human. You wonder briefly where the rest of the bones are.

>get teeth
You have absolutely no need for those. What are you going to do, make a necklace?

>put teeth on branch
Try combining the teeth with the branch.

>combine teeth with branch
(first taking the teeth)
You have absolutely no need for those. What are you going to do, make a necklace?

>* "try combining the teeth with the branch" isn't a very helpful response
Noted.

The woods seem pretty dark. Maybe you should find a light source.

You fashion a torch from the branch and the remains of your wedding gown.

Noted.

>x vial
In the vial is an oily black liquid.

>open it
You open the vial.

>x liquid
A thick, black liquid that appears to be oil.

>smell liquid
It's pretty foul-smelling.

Try pouring the oily black liquid on the torch.

>* it would be more helpful if PUT X ON Y could just automatically try the suggested command
Noted.

You pour the oily black liquid onto the torch and discard the empty vial.

Those can't contain things.

Outside the Dragon's Cave
You are standing before a large cave. The entrance has been blocked by a large wooden door.

>x door
The large door almost perfectly fills in the natural opening in the rock. There is a golden knocker in the shape of a dragon's tail about a foot above your head.

>x knocker
The large door almost perfectly fills in the natural opening in the rock. There is a golden knocker in the shape of a dragon's tail about a foot above your head.

>knock
(the cave door)
You grab the knocker and bang on the door.

The door opens and the dragon sticks his nose through the opening. He says, "Well, a princess! I love to eat princesses, but I have already eaten a whole castle today. I am a very tired dragon. Come back tomorrow." 

Then he slams the door in your face.

>g
(the cave door)
You bang on the door again.

The dragon sticks his nose out the door and says, "I am sure you are very delicious, but I am rather tired and stuffed. Please do come back tomorrow."

This time he pauses a moment before slamming the door.

>g
(the cave door)
You already have the dragon's attention.

>in
The door into the cave leads east. The only escape is back into the forest. You came to rescue Roland, and you are not leaving without him!

>* should be equivalent to EAST
Noted.

>e
The dragon is blocking the doorway and will not allow you to pass.

>talk to dragon
"Wait!" you exclaim.

Surprised, the dragon steps entirely out of the cave, nudging the door shut with his tail.

You say, "Is it true that you are the smartest and fiercest dragon in the whole world?"

"Yes," says the dragon. Boastful fellow, isn't he?

>g
You say, "Is it true that you are the smartest and fiercest dragon in the whole world?"

"Yes," says the dragon. Boastful fellow, isn't he?

>admire dragon
That's not a verb I recognize.

>x dragon
Up close, you realize this dragon isn't actually very large, only about fifteen cubits from the tip of its nose to the spiked end of its tail. Its green scales shimmer in the glow of your torch.

>tell dragon about dragon
The dragon says, "I'm afraid I don't know anything about that."

>x scales
You can't see any such thing.

>x tail
You can't see any such thing.

>x nose
You can't see any such thing.

>* should be synonyms for the dragon
Noted.

You can see a dragon here.

The dragon is much larger and stronger than you. Perhaps you can outwit it in some way.

>tell dragon about me
The dragon says, "I love to eat princesses, but I have already eaten a whole castle today. Come back tomorrow."

You remove the gift bag, folding it carefully.

The dragon has better things to do.

>knock
(the cave door)
You already have the dragon's attention.

>x knocker
The large door almost perfectly fills in the natural opening in the rock. There is a golden knocker in the shape of a dragon's tail about a foot above your head.

>ask dragon about castle
The dragon says, "That's very kind of you to offer, but I have already eaten a whole castle today."

"That was my home!" you shout.

>ask dragon about fire
"Is it true," you say, "that you can burn up ten forests with your fiery breath?"

"Oh, yes," says the dragon, and he takes a huge, deep breath and breathes out so much fire that he burns up fifty forests.

Wasn't that amazing?

>yes
"Fantastic!" you exclaim. "Do it again!"

The dragon takes another huge breath and breathes out so much fire that he burns up one hundred forests.

Were you impressed by that display?

>yes
"Magnificent!" you shout. "Do it again!"

The dragon takes another huge breath. But this time, nothing comes out.

>ask dragon about flying
You say, "Dragon, is it true that you can fly around the world in just ten seconds?"

"Why, yes," says the dragon, and he jumps up and flies around the world in just ten seconds. He seems very tired when he returns.

Wasn't that amazing?

>yes
"Fantastic!" you exclaim. "Do it again!"

The dragon jumps up and flies around the whole world in just twenty seconds. When he returns, he flops down on the ground.

The dragon is so tired that he falls fast asleep.

>x dragon
The dragon is finally asleep. You should rescue Roland and leave, before it wakes up.

>e
You ought to cover up first.

>wear bag
You slip the makeshift dress over your head and pull it down past your hips.

>e
(first opening the cave door)
You step over the dragon and open the door to the cave.

The Dragon's Cave
This is where the dragon lives. Piles of treasure fill the room, reflecting light in every direction.

Your betrothed, Roland, stands before you.

Roland looks at you and says, "Elizabeth, you are a mess! You smell like ashes, your hair is all tangled, and you are wearing a dirty paper bag. Come back when you are dressed like a real princess."

>x roland
Roland is the most attractive man you have ever laid eyes on. Too bad he's also the biggest jerk you've ever met!

>kick roland
That's not a verb I recognize.

>specifically, where it hurts
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>x treasure
There is more gold and precious gems here than you have ever seen before in your life.

>goodbye
You say goodbye to Roland.

>w
"Roland," you say, "your clothes are really pretty, and your hair is very neat. You look like a real prince, but you are also a real jerk.

You turn around and walk out the door.



    *** And Elizabeth lived happily ever after! ***
