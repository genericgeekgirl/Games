This is the day you've always dreamed of. You are finally marrying the love of
your life, prince Roland.


Castle Garden
You are standing in the garden behind your family's castle. On this lovely fall
evening, it is doing double duty as a wedding chapel.

Your betrothed, Roland, stands before you.

You can also see Father Alfred here.

>**Probably "Prince Roland" rather than "prince Roland."
That's not a verb I recognize.

>look at roland
Roland is the most attractive man you have ever laid eyes on.

Father Alfred begins the ceremony, "We are gathered here today to witness the
joining of two hearts." Roland smiles shyly at you.

>look at father alfred
Father Alfred has been your family's minister for as long as you can remember.

"If anyone has a reason why these two should not be wed, speak now or forever
hold your peace." You hold your breath for a second, wondering whether anyone
will speak up. Fortunately, nobody does and you relax.

>speak up
Whom do you want to speak that to?

>alfred
Father Alfred smiles kindly at you and continues the ceremony.

"Who gives this woman--" You glare icily at the minister. You are nobody's
property. "Ahem. Moving on," says the minister, visibly flustered. Roland looks
at you questioningly, but says nothing.

>think about roland
I only understood you as far as wanting to think.

>talk to roland
You lean in towards Roland and whisper in his ear. Roland smiles at you and
holds a finger over his lips in an exaggerated "shush" motion.

"Love is a wonderful thing." And so on. You're too excited to pay attention to
every word.

You lean in towards Roland and whisper in his ear. Roland smiles at you and
holds a finger over his lips in an exaggerated "shush" motion.

"Elizabeth, do you take Roland to be your husband?"

>wait
You beam happily at Roland.

>maybe
That's not a verb I recognize.

>no
You shake your head. "No. I don't."

Oh.

There's a pause, and then the guests begin to murmur. The minister frowns.
"Elizabeth, are you sure?" he asks. Roland just stares at you in shock. You
whisper, "I'm so sorry," and run off.



    *** And they didn't get married after all! ***



Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, QUIT, or UNDO the last command?

Castle Garden
You are standing in the garden behind your family's castle. On this lovely fall
evening, it is doing double duty as a wedding chapel.

Your betrothed, Roland, stands before you.

You can also see Father Alfred here.

"Elizabeth, do you take Roland to be your husband?"

>**Implement the castle?
That's not a verb I recognize.

>yes
Of course you do!

The minister smiles at you and turns to Roland. "And, Roland, do you take
Elizabeth to be your wife?"

Roland grins at you and exclaims, "I do!".

"I now pronounce you man and... dragon?!?" The minister's eyes go wide, seconds
before he is incinerated by a burst of flame.

A large dragon flies overhead. The wedding guests scatter in every direction.
You cower against Roland, but he pushes you towards the dragon and runs towards
the road.

The dragon eats all the guests it can catch, and when it has had its fill, it
smashes your castle to smithereens with its heavy tail and sets the remains on
fire. You are nearly caught in a blaze of flame as you duck behind what used to
be the stone wall of the garden. You are unhurt, but your fine gown snags on a
rose bush and tears.

As the dragon finally turns to go, it catches sight of Roland, running down the
road towards the river. It swoops down and smashes the bridge just as Roland is
about to cross it and catches he up in its claws. The dragon flies away with
your beloved prince.

Castle Ruins
This used to be your home. Now it is nothing more than a smoking pile of rubble.
The smoke obscures your view of the stars, and the primary source of light is
the burning remains of your furniture.

The only road away from the castle now ends abruptly at the river bank. The
forest surrounds you thickly on all sides, except for an area to the north where
the trees have been broken and scorched.

>**change to "catches him up"
That's not a verb I recognize.

>x rubble
These piles of brick and wood used to be your home.

>search rubble
You dig through the piles of rubble until you find a paper bag.

>take bag
Taken.

>look in bag
You find nothing of interest.

>n
Perhaps you should find something to wear first!

>i
You are carrying a paper bag.

>x me
You are young and beautiful, too lovely to be described in mere words. You are,
however, in dire need of a bath and a change of clothes.

You are stark naked, save for a handful of rags and a tarnished gold crown.

>wear bag
You quickly fashion a dress out of the gift bag. It's not as fancy as you're
used to, but it'll get the job done.

You strip off the remains of your wedding gown.

You slip the makeshift dress over your head and pull it down past your hips.

Burnt Forest
There's a trail of burned trees and what appear to be teeth leading to the
northeast. One tree in particular catches your eye.

>x tree
You examine the tree more closely. Someone has carved "PLUGH" into the trunk.

>x trunk
You can't see any such thing.

>climb tree
I don't think much is to be achieved by that.

>ne
The woods seem pretty dark. Maybe you should find a light source.

>say "plugh"
POOF! Your fairy godmother appears. "Tsk," she says. "Poor girl. I'm not sure I
can help you with this one." She pauses and rummages around in her pockets,
pulling out a vial. She hands it to you. "This is the best I can do. Use it
wisely." Then she vanishes, as quickly as she appeared.

>x vial
 It's a vial of thick, black liquid.

>drink liquid
You can't see any such thing.

Taken.

You fashion a torch from the branch and the remains of your wedding gown.

You pour the oily black liquid onto the torch.

Outside the Dragon's Cave
You are standing before a large cave. The entrance has been blocked by a large
wooden door.

>x door
The large door almost perfectly fills in the natural opening in the rock. There
is a golden knocker in the shape of a dragon's tail about a foot above your
head.

>x knocker
The large door almost perfectly fills in the natural opening in the rock. There
is a golden knocker in the shape of a dragon's tail about a foot above your
head.

>knock
(the cave door)
You grab the knocker and bang on the door.

The door opens and the dragon sticks his nose through the opening. He says,
"Well, a princess! I love to eat princesses, but I have already eaten a whole
castle today. I am a very tired dragon. Come back tomorrow." 

Then he slams the door in your face.

>g
(the cave door)
You bang on the door again.

The dragon sticks his nose out the door and says, "I am sure you are very
delicious, but I am rather tired and stuffed. Please do come back tomorrow."

This time he pauses a moment before slamming the door.

>g
(the cave door)
You already have the dragon's attention.

>yell
"Wait!" you exclaim.

The dragon rolls his eyes and steps entirely out of the cave, nudging the door
shut with his tail.

>x dragon
Up close, you realize this dragon isn't actually very large, only about fifteen
cubits from the tip of its nose to the spiked end of its tail. Its green scales
shimmer in the glow of your torch.

>save
Ok.

>ask dragon about castle
The dragon says, "I'm afraid I don't know anything about that."

>ask about dragon
You say, "Is it true that you are the smartest and fiercest dragon in the whole
world?"

"Yes", says the dragon. Boastful fellow, isn't he?

>**In American practice, the comma would go inside the quotation marks. "Yes," says the dragon.

>ask about eating
The dragon says, "I'm afraid I don't know anything about that."

>ask about killing
The dragon says, "I'm afraid I don't know anything about that."

>ask about prince
The dragon says, "I love to eat royals, but I have already eaten a whole castle
today. I am saving your beloved for later."

>ask dragon for prince
The dragon does not respond.

>ask dragon about princess
The dragon says, "I'm afraid I don't know anything about that."

>ask dragon about attack
The dragon says, "I'm afraid I don't know anything about that."

>ask dragon about flame
"Is it true," you say, "that you can burn up ten forests with your fiery
breath?"

"Oh, yes", says the dragon, and he takes a huge, deep breath and breathes out so
much fire that he burns up fifty forests.


Were you impressed by that display?


"Fantastic!" you exclaim. "Do it again!"

The dragon takes another huge breath and breathes out so much fire that he burns
up one hundred forests.


Wasn't that amazing?


"Magnificent!" you shout. "Do it again!"

The dragon takes another huge breath. But this time, nothing comes out.


>e

The door is locked. Perhaps you should try knocking.

>ask dragon about dragon
You say, "Is it true that you are the smartest and fiercest dragon in the whole

"Yes", says the dragon. Boastful fellow, isn't he?

>ask dragon about dragons
The dragon says, "I'm afraid I don't know anything about that."

>**Perhaps a reply would be good here, too.
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>ask dragon about flying
You say, "Dragon, is it true that you can fly around the world in just ten
seconds?"

"Why, yes," says the dragon, and he jumps up and flies around the world in just
ten seconds. He seems very tired when he returns.


Were you impressed by that display?


"Fantastic!" you exclaim. "Do it again!"

The dragon jumps up and flies around the whole world in just twenty seconds.
When he returns, he flops down on the ground.


The dragon is so tired that he falls fast asleep.

The Dragon's Cave
This is where the dragon lives. Piles of treasure fill the room, reflecting
light in every direction.

Your betrothed, Roland, stands before you.

Roland looks at you and says, "Elizabeth, you are a mess! You smell like ashes,
your hair is all tangled, and you are wearing a dirty paper bag. Come back when
you are dressed like a real princess."

>hit roland
You slap Roland! "Roland," you say, "your clothes are really pretty, and your
hair is very neat. You look like a real prince, but you are a jerk.
