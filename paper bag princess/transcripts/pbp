[page]/22:02 Ghogg says (to genericgeekgirl), "that is, plenty of games let you use a branch straight -- say, mulldoon -- but you want a longer-term light source and you could've mentioned something lke 'the branch would burn out too fast as is'"
[whisper]|22:03 genericgeekgirl says (to Ghogg), "Ohhh. Hm, ok. It would have never even occurred to me to do that."

[geekiness]|21:57 Ghogg says, "stuck on a puzzle"
[geekiness]|21:58 Ghogg says, "light source. give me a little time first here"
[geekiness]|22:00 Ghogg says, "got through that"
[geekiness]|22:00 Ghogg says, "(the 'you didn't do it right' messages could have been slightly less enigmatic)"
[geekiness]|22:01 Ghogg says, "now I'm stuck on the maze, hm"
[geekiness]|22:02 Ghogg says (to genericgeekgirl), "It's more like 'you're on the right track' could have been specific as to the justification"
[geekiness]|22:02 genericgeekgirl says (to Ghogg), "(Noted.)"
[geekiness]|22:06 Ghogg says, "still wandering the maze"
[geekiness]|22:08 Ghogg says, "through, not sure how"
[geekiness]|22:09 Ghogg says, "ok done"
[geekiness]|22:10 Ghogg asks, "so what's the deal with the maze?"
[geekiness]|22:12 Ghogg says, "didn't see any items"
[geekiness]|22:13 Ghogg says, "I do think some sort of running commentary might have made that better, then"
[geekiness]|22:13 Ghogg says, "because I got the frustration without the resolution"
[geekiness]|22:13 Ghogg says, "well, first, make it a shorter gag"
[geekiness]|22:13 Ghogg says, "second, have some messages that make it clear (at least in retrospect) it was a gag"
[geekiness]|22:14 Ghogg says, "dude, it went through 150 turns for me"
[geekiness]|22:14 Ghogg says, "I have the turn count right here"
[geekiness]|22:14 Ghogg says, "I was just spinning around on random"
[geekiness]|22:14 Ghogg says, "I don't think the same direction increasing was a good idea, since it is non-obvious"
[geekiness]|22:17 Ghogg says, ";heh, I like saying no at the wedding"
[geekiness]|22:19 Ghogg says (to genericgeekgirl), "anyway, it usually is a good idea to have your puzzles so people realize how they solved them at the end. so I do think it's possible to 'fix' this one"
