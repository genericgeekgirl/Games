I enjoyed your game & my main technical concern is that the necklace gets lost in the shuffle a bit. Semicolons note other things I had questions about.

I was worried going into the forest that my light source would go out & I'd have liked a bit more indication of what would happen. E.g. your fairy godmother helped you, and maybe she should say 'It will last just long enough' or something.

That allows for narrative which I think the player would enjoy when stuck in the forest e.g. 'You have to be close to the dragon's cave.'

I got stuck finding what to ask the dragon about as well, but I could and should have figured it out. I'd have liked to see hints in response to this as well as an AMUSING section at the end--because I have a feeling this game put various touches I missed, and I want to see them.



>kiss father
You can only do that to something animate.

>kiss alfred
Keep your mind on the game.


>attack rubble
Violence isn't the answer to this one.

You dig through the piles of rubble until you find a paper bag.

That's hardly portable.

>get rubble
That's hardly portable.

>sit on rubble
That's not something you can sit down on.

>get all
oily black liquid: The vial isn't open.

>plugh
You hear a faint sound in the distance. Help does not arrive.

>climb tree
I don't think much is to be achieved by that.

>x teeth
Yes, those are definitely teeth. They come in a variety of shapes and sizes, most of which do not appear to be human. You wonder briefly where the rest of the bones are.

>get bones
You can't see any such thing.

>pour liquid on tree
There isn't very much in the bottle. You shouldn't waste it.

>pour liquid on teeth
There isn't very much in the bottle. You shouldn't waste it.

You fashion a torch from the branch and the remains of your wedding gown.

>; the 'not quite' clues are good
>; but maybe say why


>i
You are carrying a torch and a vial.

>ne
The woods seem pretty dark. Maybe you should find a light source.

>light torch
The torch needs something else.

>pour vial on torch
You pour the oily black liquid onto the torch and discard the empty vial.

>put torch on fire
You light the torch with the flames.


>think
What a good idea.

>w
As you emerge from the forest, the torch suddenly fizzles out.

Outside the Dragon's Cave
You are standing before a large cave. The entrance has been blocked by a large wooden door.

>w
The door leads into the cave. The only escape is back into the forest. You came to rescue Roland, and you are not leaving without him!
[TODO: also you no longer have a source of light]


>x torch
It is a torch crafted from a branch and the remains of your wedding gown.

>; mention lit or not?
That's not a verb I recognize.


>
I beg your pardon?

You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

Violence isn't the answer to this one.

>kick door
That's not a verb I recognize.




>knock
(the cave door)
You already have the dragon's attention.

>talk to dragon
"Wait!" you exclaim.

Surprised, the dragon steps entirely out of the cave, nudging the door shut with its tail.

You say, "Is it true that you are the smartest and fiercest dragon in the whole world?"

"Yes," says the dragon. Boastful fellow, isn't he?

>yes
That was a rhetorical question.

>talk to dragon
You say, "Is it true that you are the smartest and fiercest dragon in the whole world?"

"Yes," says the dragon. Boastful fellow, isn't he?

>talk to dragon
You say, "Is it true that you are the smartest and fiercest dragon in the whole world?"

"Yes," says the dragon. Boastful fellow, isn't he?

>ask dragon about roland
The dragon says, "Oh, yes. I love to eat royals. But I have already eaten a whole castle today, so I am saving your prince for later."

"Where is he?" you cry.

"I cannot tell you that," says the dragon, although it casts a nervous look towards the cave.

>ask about castle
The dragon says, "That's very kind of you to offer, but I have already eaten a whole castle today."

"That was my home!" you shout.

The dragon shrugs. It doesn't seem particularly inclined to apologize.

>ask about home
The dragon says, "I'm afraid I don't know anything about that."



>take knocker
That's hardly portable.

>ask about torch
The dragon laughs at you.

>i
You are carrying a torch.

The door is locked. Perhaps you should try knocking.

Keep your mind on the game.

You're really not in the mood to do that.

You already have that.

You should leave that on. A princess should never be without her crown.

You jump on the spot, fruitlessly.
