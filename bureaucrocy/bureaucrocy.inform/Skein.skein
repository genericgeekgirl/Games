If you can see an object, you can usually just interact with it directly without worrying about your position. Try a command like EXAMINE TICKET DISPENSER for a closer look at something, LOOK to get a new description of this location, or a direction like UP (or U) to move to a different location.

To stop these messages entirely, type NOVICE OFF.

Getting your Card Carrying Qualification is the first step in the Bureaucratic Artsss. Yesss, and once you have it, you are on your way to being able to obtain Your Papersss (and all sorts of licenses and permits). It used to be you could acquire the bureaucratic documentsss directly from a friend--Oh, it&apos;sss perfectly legal, mind you--but seemsss like you&apos;re the only one around. You&apos;ll have to go the official route and deal with the red tape. Head over to the Bureaucratic Hall on Gregariousss Grange and talk to one of my friendsss there.

A bureaucroc calls out, &quot;Alexandra! Your turn!&quot;

&gt;[6] approach
(the counter)
The bureaucroc says, &quot;So you&apos;re requesting Papers are you, Alexandra? Manager Snifflenose is the official you need to speak to. Please bear with me a moment.&quot; Then he turns and shuffles away.

&gt;[7] z
Another bureaucroc, presumably Manager Snifflenose, approaches the counter. &quot;What&apos;s this, then? You&apos;re hoping to acquire Papers, correct?&quot; He stares intently at you.

Y/N? &gt;[8] y
The bureaucroc says, &quot;I don&apos;t see why not. First, however, one question:&quot;
1 - Innie?
2 - Outie?

The bureaucroc nods and says, &quot;Excellent. The bureau charges 100 currants. Cash only, I&apos;m afraid.&quot;

You count out a pile of currants, and The bureaucroc hands over Papers.

&quot;Thank you for your business. To conduct another transaction, you must exit and re-enter the Hall.&quot;

As you make your way back down to the Subway Station, a Bureaucroc corners you on the stairs. He whispers, &quot;Psssst. Here&apos;sss the deal. Getting your Card Carrying Qualification is the first step in the Bureaucratic Artsss. Yesss, and once you have it, you are on your way to being able to obtain Your Papersss (and all sorts of licenses and permits). It used to be you could acquire the bureaucratic documentsss directly from a friend--Oh, it&apos;sss perfectly legal, mind you--but seemsss like you&apos;re the only one around. You&apos;ll have to go the official route and deal with the red tape. Head over to the Bureaucratic Hall on Gregariousss Grange and talk to one of my friendsss there. You&apos;ll get what you need.&quot; And then he disappears as quickly as he appeared.

That was weird.

To the left is a waiting area with a water cooler and a bunch of hard, plastic orange chairs. To the right is a counter, behind which is a Bureaucroc. A sign reads &quot;Please approach the counter for assistance.&quot;

&gt;[5] approach
(the counter)
A bureaucroc says, &quot;We will be with you as soon as possible. Now please sit down and wait.&quot; He then proceeds to ignore you.

&gt;[1] sit
(on the chair)
You take a seat on one of their uncomfortable plastic chairs.

&gt;[2] z
Time passes.

&gt;[3] z
Time passes.

&gt;[4] z
Time passes.

&gt;[5] z
Time passes.

A bureaucroc calls out, &quot;Alexandra! Come forward!&quot;

&gt;[6] approach
(the counter)
The bureaucroc says, &quot;Alexandra? If you are seeking Papers, you must speak to Magister Wigglesbottom. Please wait while I see if they&apos;re taking appointments today.&quot; Then he turns and shuffles away.

&gt;[7] z
Another bureaucroc, presumably Magister Wigglesbottom, approaches the counter. &quot;What&apos;s this, then? You&apos;re hoping to acquire Papers, correct?&quot; He stares intently at you.

Y/N? &gt;[8] y
The bureaucroc says, &quot;I imagine we can help. But first, please choose between the following:&quot;
1 - Pirates
2 - Ninjas

1/2?&gt;[9] 1
The bureaucroc nods and says, &quot;Very well. In that case, the fee is 100 currants, and we only take cash.&quot;

You count out a pile of currants, and the bureaucroc hands over Papers.

&quot;Thank you for your business. To conduct another transaction, you must exit and re-enter the Hall.&quot;

&gt;[1] take pen
You cast a nervous look around you before yanking the pen hard enough to snap the chain. A bureaucroc looks up at the sound, and you panic.

Gregarious Grange
The entrance to the subway is down a flight of stairs. You can also go inside Bureaucratic Hall.

&gt;[2] complete
(Papers)
You cross your &quot;i&apos;s and dot your &quot;t&apos;s. Or maybe it&apos;s the other way around. In any case, you manage to complete your Papers without too much trouble.
Well done. Now go ride a subway!

&gt;[3] down
As you make your way back down to the Subway Station, a Bureaucroc corners you on the stairs. He whispers, &quot;Psssst. Here&apos;sss the deal. Getting your Card Carrying Qualification is the first step in the Bureaucratic Artsss. Yesss, and once you have it, you are on your way to being able to obtain Your Papersss (and all sorts of licenses and permits). It used to be you could acquire the bureaucratic documentsss directly from a friend--Oh, it&apos;sss perfectly legal, mind you--but seemsss like you&apos;re the only one around. You&apos;ll have to go the official route and deal with the red tape. Head over to the Bureaucratic Hall on Gregariousss Grange and talk to one of my friendsss there. You&apos;ll get what you need.&quot; And then he disappears as quickly as he appeared.

That was weird.

Subway Station
This is the subway station below Gregarious Grange, Groddle Meadow. A flight of stairs leads up to the street.

You can see a ticket dispenser here.

&gt;[4] buy ticket
(the subway ticket)
The ticket dispenser says, &quot;Train tickets cost 50C. Which line would you like to ride?&quot;

    <result xml:space="preserve">As you make your way back down to the Subway Station, a Bureaucroc corners you on the stairs. He whispers, &quot;Psssst. Here&apos;sss the deal. Getting your Card Carrying Qualification is the first step in the Bureaucratic Artsss. Yesss, and once you have it, you are on your way to being able to obtain Your Papersss (and all sorts of licenses and permits). It used to be you could acquire the bureaucratic documentsss directly from a friend--Oh, it&apos;sss perfectly legal, mind you--but seemsss like you&apos;re the only one around. You&apos;ll have to go the official route and deal with the red tape. Head over to the Bureaucratic Hall on Gregariousss Grange and talk to one of my friendsss there. You&apos;ll get what you need.&quot; And then he disappears as quickly as he appeared.

That was weird.

Subway Station

A sign proclaims this room to be the &quot;Department of Administrative Affairs - Ministry of Departments&quot;.

A sign reads &quot;Please approach the counter for assistance.&quot;

(the counter)
The bureaucroc says, &quot;Go away. We don&apos;t have time to waste on people who have not learned any Bureaucratic Arts.&quot;

The entrance to the subway is down a flight of stairs. You can also go inside Bureaucratic Hall.

&gt;[4] down
As you make your way back down to the Subway Station, a Bureaucroc corners you on the stairs. He whispers, &quot;Psssst. Here&apos;sss the deal. Getting your Card Carrying Qualification is the first step in the Bureaucratic Artsss. Yesss, and once you have it, you are on your way to being able to obtain Your Papersss (and all sorts of licenses and permits). It used to be you could acquire the bureaucratic documentsss directly from a friend--Oh, it&apos;sss perfectly legal, mind you--but seemsss like you&apos;re the only one around. You&apos;ll have to go the official route and deal with the red tape. Head over to the Bureaucratic Hall on Gregariousss Grange and talk to one of my friendsss there. You&apos;ll get what you need.&quot; And then he disappears as quickly as he appeared.

That was weird.

Subway Station
This is the subway station below Gregarious Grange, Groddle Meadow. A flight of stairs leads up to the street.

You can see a ticket dispenser here.

A bureaucroc calls out, &quot;Alexandra! You&apos;re up!&quot;

&gt;[6] approach
(the counter)
The bureaucroc says, &quot;I understand you&apos;re hoping to attain Card-Carrying Qualification, Alexandra. That&apos;s a matter for Manager Earwick. Let me find out if they&apos;re in the office this week.&quot; Then he turns and shuffles away.

&gt;[7] z
Another bureaucroc, presumably Manager Earwick, approaches the counter. &quot;Right then, let&apos;s see... You&apos;re here hoping to procure Card-Carrying Qualification, are you?&quot; He stares intently at you.

Y/N? &gt;[8] y
The bureaucroc says, &quot;That should be possible. First, however, one question:&quot;
1 - Innie?
2 - Outie?

1/2?&gt;[9] 1
The bureaucroc nods and says, &quot;Very well. The fee is 50 currants. We only accept cash.&quot;

You count out a pile of currants, and the bureaucroc hands over Card-Carrying Qualification.

&quot;Thank you for your business. To conduct another transaction, you must exit and re-enter the Hall.&quot;

You cast a nervous look around you before yanking the pen hard enough to snap the chain. A bureaucroc looks up at the sound, and you panic. You find yourself outside Bureaucratic Hall.

As you make your way back down to the Subway Station, a Bureaucroc corners you on the stairs. He whispers, &quot;Psssst. Here&apos;sss the deal. Getting your Card Carrying Qualification is the first step in the Bureaucratic Artsss. Yesss, and once you have it, you are on your way to being able to obtain Your Papersss (and all sorts of licenses and permits). It used to be you could acquire the bureaucratic documentsss directly from a friend--Oh, it&apos;sss perfectly legal, mind you--but seemsss like you&apos;re the only one around. You&apos;ll have to go the official route and deal with the red tape. Head over to the Bureaucratic Hall on Gregariousss Grange and talk to one of my friendsss there. You&apos;ll get what you need.&quot; And then he disappears as quickly as he appeared.

That was weird.

The bureaucroc nods and says, &quot;I&apos;ll take that. The fee is 50 currants, and I&apos;ll take that, as well. In cash.&quot;

Bureaucratic Hall
A sign proclaims this room to be the &quot;Department of Administrative Affairs - Ministry of Departments&quot;. To the left is a waiting area with a water cooler and a bunch of hard, plastic orange chairs. To the right is a counter, behind which is a Bureaucroc. Another sign reads &quot;Please approach the counter for assistance.&quot;

&gt;[5] approach
(the counter)
A bureaucroc says, &quot;We will be with you as soon as possible. Now please sit down and wait.&quot; He then proceeds to ignore you.

The bureaucroc says, &quot;So you&apos;re requesting Card-Carrying Qualification are you, Alexandra? Director Tummyford is the official you need to speak to. Please bear with me a moment.&quot; Then he turns and shuffles away.

&gt;[7] z
Another bureaucroc, presumably Director Tummyford, approaches the counter. &quot;Let&apos;s see here. You are interested in obtaining Card-Carrying Qualification, correct?&quot; He stares intently at you.

Y/N? &gt;[8] y
The bureaucroc says, &quot;I should be able to rubber stamp this. But first, please choose between the following:&quot;
1 - Pirates
2 - Ninjas

1/2?&gt;[9] 1
The bureaucroc nods and says, &quot;Very well. In that case, the fee is 50 currants, and we only take cash.&quot;

You count out a pile of currants, and the bureaucroc hands over Card-Carrying Qualification.

&quot;Thank you for your business. To conduct another transaction, you must exit and re-enter the Hall.&quot;

Congratulations! You have taken the first step toward Bureaucratic officialdom. As with all first steps, there is a second, a third... Once you learn Bureaucratic Arts, then get and complete your Papers, you&apos;ll be able to use public transportation.

&gt;[3] learn
(Bureaucratic Arts)
Well done: you can now obtain papers with only the requisite amount of hassle and annoyance.

&gt;[4] in

Bureaucratic Hall
A sign proclaims this room to be the &quot;Department of Administrative Affairs - Ministry of Departments&quot;. To the left is a waiting area with a water cooler and a bunch of hard, plastic orange chairs. To the right is a counter, behind which is a Bureaucroc. Another sign reads &quot;Please approach the counter for assistance.&quot;

&gt;[5] approach
(the counter)
A bureaucroc says, &quot;We will be with you as soon as possible. Now please sit down and wait.&quot; He then proceeds to ignore you.

A bureaucroc calls out, &quot;Alexandra! You&apos;re up!&quot;

&gt;[6] approach
(the counter)
The bureaucroc says, &quot;Alexandra, your request for Papers will have to be passed along to the correct department. Please wait while I ascertain the availability of Magister Piksnixson.&quot; Then he turns and shuffles away.

&gt;[7] z
Another bureaucroc, presumably Magister Piksnixson, approaches the counter. &quot;What do we have here, then? I see. So, it&apos;s Papers you&apos;re after, is it?&quot; He stares intently at you.

Y/N? &gt;[8] y
The bureaucroc says, &quot;I may be able to help you with that. Before that, though, your favorite color?&quot;
1 - Beige
2 - Not Beige

1/2?&gt;[9] 1
The bureaucroc nods and says, &quot;Very well. In that case, the fee is 100 currants, and we only take cash.&quot;

You count out a pile of currants, and the bureaucroc hands over Papers.

&quot;Thank you for your business. To conduct another transaction, you must exit and re-enter the Hall.&quot;
